Those are my eyes! Ow! That hurts!” \nGirl: “Wha? That’s gross. Why do you have eyes THERE?” \nAlien: “Huh? Is that odd? Eh? Um…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Your front’s all slippery…” \nAlien: “I-I’m sorry… I’m a little nervous, so I’m sweating…” \nGirl: “Huh? Sweating?” \nAlien: “What? What is it? Do you find me… odd?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “E… Er… You’re worrying me with the sudden silence.” \nGirl: “Are these ears?” \nAlien: “Ah! Ah! No, don’t pull on that! That doesn’t feel good at all! AHH!” \nGirl: “Huh? Sorry.” *let go* \nAlien: “Wh… whew… Y-You caught me off-guard.” \nAlien: “…Please, be more careful. If we were the same species, that could have been seen as an attack on me.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…I’m not quite sure how I’d describe you, honestly. It’s… tough.” \nGirl: “…I guess you have arms and legs, at least. But as for how many… man, that’s just not right.” \nGirl: “Are you really an alien?” \nAlien: “Well, I wouldn’t likely consider MYSELF an alien… But you would, certainly.” \nGirl: “So you came from space?” \nAlien: “Indeed.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Don’t aliens talk their own alien language?” \nAlien: “Ah, yes. I’m using a mechanism that translates our language into yours, and vice versa.” \nGirl: “?” \nAlien: “Err… simply put, I’m using special technology that enables us to understand each other.” \nGirl: “Hmm…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “I don’t get it, but it sure sounds fancy.” \nAlien: “A matter of course! Your level of technology is one we passed nearly 40,000 years ago.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Ey.” *poke* \nAlien: “Ow! That hurts! Don’t poke me!” \nGirl: “Then stop bragging!” *poke poke* \nAlien: “I’m sorry! I won’t brag any more! I promise I won’t brag!” \nGirl: “…Sure.” \nGirl: “But I’ll still poke you.” *poke poke* \nAlien: “Ack! No! Not there!” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “Oof… You’re kind of a bully, you know that?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Well, I know you must be a tad uneasy… and I’m in no position to be fussy.” \nAlien: “Apologizes, but could I stay here a little while?” \nGirl: “Why?” \nAlien: “I explained it more briefly earlier, but I require power to sustain myself and to operate my space ship.” \nAlien: “All I need is enough energy for a short transmission to my mothership, so it won’t need to be much…” \nGirl: “Power… so, oil or something?” \nAlien: “Ah, no. What we use as a power source is the emotions of living things.” \nGirl: “…I don’t get you.” \nAlien: “Huh?” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “A-Ah… I’m sorry.” \nAlien: “While I suppose it’s ordinary to us, I can easily see how the technology of your planet is lacking such that it sounds odd indeed.” \nGirl: “Ey.” *poke* \nAlien: “Wh…! I-I wasn’t trying to brag that time! Sorry!” \nGirl: “…Go on.” \nAlien: “A… Anyway, yes, we have technology to convert the emotions of creatures into a power source.” \nAlien: “The more intelligent the lifeform and the purer the emotion, the more energy it will yield.” \nGirl: “I don’t quite get it… But so, you want me to get mad, and laugh, and cry?” \nAlien: “Indeed! I’m glad you understand.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “But then will I lose those feelings, or what?” \nAlien: “No, there’s no need to worry about that.” \nAlien: “It’s not as if it takes away your faculty to produce those emotions. It’s merely utilizing the emotions themselves.” \nGirl: “Well, that’s alright, I guess.” \nAlien: “Thank you muchly. Then allow me to attach the equipment.” \nGirl: “…Sure.” \nAlien: “Very well then… How about…” *place* \nGirl: “Ack! Pervert!” \nAlien: “Huh?” \nGirl: “…you’re gross…” \nAlien: “I-I assure you, it wasn’t intentional. Of course, being that we’re different species, please don’t think ill of me for it.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “You’re all ready now.” \nGirl: “Hmm.” \nAlien: “Now, would you laugh for me?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Ah… ahaha?” \nAlien: “That won’t do. Not one bit. There’s no feeling in it.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Ey.” *poke* \nAlien: “Ow! That hurts! Why did you…?! Sorry!” \n \n#2ch \nI wanna know where he put it… \n \n#OP \nGirl: “If you’ve got a problem with my emotions, then put it on yourself.” \nAlien: “I’d absolutely love to do so, but as half of us is non-living, our emotional yield is rather poor.” \nGirl: “Huh?” \nAlien: “What? Does that surprise you?” \nGirl: “I think it’s pretty surprising. Half of you’s not living?” \nAlien: “Indeed. Half-living life forms are not uncommon in the cosmos.” \nGirl: “What’s the half of you that’s not living, then?” \nAlien: “It differs from case to case, but with our species, it is a “body of information.”“ \nGirl: “Body of information…?” \nAlien: “It’s a kind of physical entity. But I don’t believe you’d be able to understand it in full.” \nAlien: “…Ah. Perhaps you could think of it as something like a ghost.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Uh… what?” \nAlien: “It will have to be a very rough explanation, but… Our ancient ancestors were ordinary creatures as one could find anywhere in the cosmos.” \nAlien: “But given their lifespan and the extent of their bodies, the transmission and collection of data was inefficient for such simple lifeforms as they.” \nAlien: “Eons in the past, they began to mechanize their bodies, and soon transferred from that to having a body of information.” \nAlien: “They successfully broke out of the cage of the physical body. But lifeforms cannot surpass certain limits, so they could not be perfect bodies of information.” \nAlien: “Omitting many details, this was how we arrived at our current state of half-information, half-lifeform.” \nGirl: “???” \nAlien: “If you don’t understand, don’t worry about it.” \nAlien: “Our bodies of information are helpful for many things, but…” \nAlien: “We require emotion for sustenance, and yet we are less inclined to producing energy with our emotions than a pure living entity.” \nAlien: “In hindsight, it’s a good lesson in how nothing can truly be perfect.” \nGirl: “Hmm… Yeah, I still barely understand.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “What kind of emotion do you want?” \nAlien: “Any kind of emotion will do, really, but I would be grateful for one with a high output.” \nGirl: “Such as?” \nAlien: “Such as… an orgasm, for example?” \nGirl: “Uh…?” \nAlien: “The feeling at the climax of a sexual intercourse, essentially the utmost feeling of pleasure. Most creatures feel immense energy in their minds during it.” \nAlien: “I believe your species has… the most standard case, with two partners mating?” \nAlien: “I would certainly be pleased if you could… Er, what’s with that look?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “……” \nGirl: “…………” *POKEPOKEPOKEPOKEPOKEPOKE!!!!* \nAlien: “Ow! Y-You’re awfully strong! What is it?! This is sudden!! Ahh! I’m sorry, I’m sorry!!” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Don’t even talk about that.” \nAlien: “Oww… What is “that,” exactly?“ \nGirl: ”…“ *cough* \nAlien: “S-Sorry! I don’t quite understand, but… understood!” \nAlien: “…Oh!” \nGirl: “?” \nAlien: “You had some strong emotion there. Given the color and shape… shyness?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Ahh… I see now! Yes, I had heard that, on rare occasion, there are cultures who feel embarrassment over matters of mating. It’s seen as rather uncivilized…” \nAlien: “Hmm… Yes, it’s my first time actually encountering it.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…..” *POKEPOKEPOKEPOKE!!!!* \nAlien: “Ow! I’m sorry! Ah, so you’re showing me your anger! I’m very grateful! Ow, but it still hurts!” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Well, I need to go to school now. Behave in my room while I’m gone.” \nAlien: “School? What do you study?” \nGirl: “Lots of things. Letters and numbers… geography and history, biology.” \nAlien: “I see. How do you study them?” \nGirl: “How…? The teacher stands in the front, explains it, and everyone listens. The usual, right?” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “What?” \nAlien: “Nothing… It just strikes me as phenomenally ineffective.” \nGirl: “?” \nGirl: “…I’ve gotta go. Be good and watch the house.” \nAlien: “Right. Take care!” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Welcome home!” \nGirl: “…Hi.” \nAlien: “Is school truly such a disagreeable place?” \nGirl: “…Eh?” \nAlien: “Forgive me if it was an intrusion, but I was monitoring your emotions from here, and I picked up a strong, continuous one.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “It was “fear.” Is it something at school that causes you to be so afraid?“ \n \n#OP \nGirl: ”…“ \nGirl: “Does it really matter? Aren’t you satisfied just having my “fear”?“ \nAlien: “Well, I suppose… But the emotion of fear also weakens one’s life force.” \nAlien: “While I wish for the success of my emotion gathering, I also worry that you may die. So it’s a complex situation.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…Hmph. You can’t do anything but sympathize and talk pretty words, can you?” \nGirl: “Given your disgusting appearance, it surprised me to hear you’re just as emotional as us… but I guess we’re different creatures after all.” \nGirl: “I’ll provide you emotion until you’re satisfied. So… just shut up already.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…You’re unexpectedly loquacious. I’m a bit surprised.” \nGirl: “…I’m going to bed.” \nAlien: “…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…Ah?!” \nAlien: “What’s the matter?” \nGirl: “!! …Dad’s calling!” \nGirl: “!” *leave* \nAlien: “???” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “It’s… fear again. And sadness, as well…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Welcome back.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Did something unfortunate happen again?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…Unlike you aliens, we can be scared over stupid little things sometimes. That’s all.” \nGirl: “Everyone’s that way. Not just me.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “On your forehead… There’s a bruise.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…Good night.” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Welcome home.” \nGirl: “…Hey.” \nAlien: “Was school an ordeal again?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Are you being bullied?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Bullies are omnipresent among living beings. Even beings of low intelligence have them.” \nAlien: “As such, it’s natural that they would exist among a race as intelligent as yours. It’s not hard to imagine the possibility.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “It’s not just your classmates at school. Isn’t it your father and mother as well?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…Shall I kill them?” \nGirl: “…Wha?” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “Shall I annihilate those who are bullying you?” \nGirl: “…What?” \nAlien: “You have done more for me to be indebted than simply keeping me over for a night.” \nAlien: “And I would be able to eradicate all traces of them…” \nAlien: “If you wish, I could also end their lives while making them suffer?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…Don’t you dare.” \nAlien: “Why do you say that?” \nGirl: “Because…” \nGirl: “Because I’m the one at fault.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “How do you mean?” \nGirl: “…I’m kind of a… demanding child, so my dad and mom hated me as I grew up.” \nGirl: “Mom blamed me for making them poor, and got mad at me, and hit me…” \nGirl: “And dad, um… he hurt me, too…” \nGirl: “But I’m alive because of dad and mom, so I really just have to endure it.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “What about school, then?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…I don’t get to have many baths, and I don’t have very many clothes, so everyone calls me “smelly” and “dirty”…“ \nGirl: “It’s not surprising… Even I think I’m dirty.” \nAlien: “…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Dad and mom raise me, so… there’s nothing I can do.” \nGirl: “And everyone at school… they’re right, because I am dirty.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “You’re very wise.” \nGirl: “Huh?” \nAlien: “You’re extremely bright for one of your species around this age.” \nAlien: “Understanding herself and her environment, and even learning how to control her emotions.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “What? That sounds weird.” \nAlien: “…I may perhaps not fully understand your race’s concept of the words, but…” \nAlien: “I perceive you as mixing up being “responsible” and being the “cause.”“ \nGirl: ”???“ \n \n#OP \nAlien: ”“Responsible” and “cause” are not the terms we use, so it will be difficult for me to explain…“ \nAlien: “You possess some causes to be mistreated, yes.” \nAlien: “The fact of being a demanding girl and the impression of uncleanliness you give could be judged as such causes.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “But it is not necessarily that this fact and this impression are the reason for which your father and mother, and your classmates, indulge in these acts.” \nAlien: “For you see, the reason they mistreat you essentially lies with they who commit the act.” \nAlien: “However, you think of the reason for these actions in such a way that your “causes” and who is “responsible” are undeniably related.“ \nGirl: ”…“ \nGirl: ”…I’m sorry. It’s too hard for me to understand.“ \nAlien: ”…I’ll try simplifying. Even if there is cause for you to be bullied, the reason for the bullying does not lie with you.“ \nAlien: “You are not at fault.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “You have certain characteristics, and as consequence are being treated ill.” \nAlien: “But it is no reason to say you are at fault, much less to say it must merely be accepted.” \nAlien: “If you wish it, I can do away with all those who tease you. That will resolve the issue.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Thank you. I was surprised, but… you talked some sense into me.” \nAlien: “Well, I was mostly intending to persuade you into the implementation of the Bully Termination Plan…” \nGirl: “But I still have to say no.” \nGirl: “If everyone at school died, their dads and moms would be really sad.” \nGirl: “And if dad and mom died, I know my real parents in heaven would be upset with me…” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “But thanks. It’s actually sort of relieving, in some weird way.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Also…” \nGirl: “Sorry… about last night.” \nAlien: “Hm?” \nGirl: “I said you were disgusting, right?” \nGirl: “Ever since I said that… I’ve been regretting it.” \nAlien: “Ah, is that right? No need to worry. You look rather odd from my outlook, too.” \nGirl: “H-Huh… Well, fine. We’re even, then.” \nGirl: “But, you… Actually, I do kind of find your little nose cute.” \nAlien: “Really? I’m having trouble thinking of your nose as very cute, unfortunately…” \nGirl: “Don’t get full of yourself!” *poke poke* \nAlien: “Ack! Ow! Stop, please! Heehee!” \nGirl: “…Geez! Why are you happy about that…? Stupid…” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “I find your decision rather unfortunate, but… I did prepare a backup plan.” \nAlien: “Put this on.” \nGirl: “What’s this?” \nAlien: “It’s a handheld defense mechanism. I made it while you were gone today.” \nGirl: “…Is this thing dangerous?” \nAlien: “Do not worry, it does no harm to others. It emits a faint electric current that affects the autonomic nervous system of others around you.” \nGirl: “???” \nAlien: “Just think of the current from the device as having a relaxing effect.” \nAlien: “It will make angry people less so, with no ill after-effects.” \nAlien: “It can’t eradicate bullying, but it should offer some relief.” \nGirl: “…Thanks.” \nAlien: “…Ah, a warm color indeed. Well, I aim to please.” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nAlien: “Welcome home.” \nGirl: “Hi! Hey, listen, I made a friend today!” \nAlien: “Oh! Is that so?” \nGirl: “Yeah! It must be thanks to that charm you gave me.” \nAlien: “That’s wonderful. Is your friend a boy or a girl?” \nGirl: “A girl. …Boys are kinda scary.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “Come to think of it, you’re a boy, right? Or are you a girl?” \nAlien: “Me? If you insist I make the distinction, I’m a girl.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Huh…” \nAlien: “What is it?” \nGirl: “Given it’s you, I was expecting you to say something crazy like “We don’t have genders as such”…“ \nAlien: “No, that’s not true at all. However, my gender carries very few social implications with it. As our species progressed, it became little more than a biological feature.” \nAlien: “In addition, our mating may be quite different from what you may imagine.” \nGirl: “M-Mating…” \nAlien: “Ah, I’m sorry. I nearly forgot about your culture feeling shyness about sexual matters.” \nGirl: “It’s fine… So, uh, how do you make children, then?” \nAlien: “A direct concatenation and division of life data.” \nGirl: “?” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “As I said before, we are half living, and half a body of information.” \nAlien: “But by half, I do not mean our bodies are literally divided down the middle.” \nAlien: “Our ancestors scientifically analyzed the phenomenon of “life,” and continued that phenomenon into a means of making a body of information.“ \nAlien: “So we are not comprised of a split between life and information… To be more exact, we are “living bodies of information.”“ \nGirl: ”…“ \nGirl: “As you might expect, I don’t get it.” \nAlien: “If I were to have a child, part of my life information would directly combine with part of my partner’s, and then divide.” \nAlien: “And that would give birth to a new living body of information. My child, if I need to say it.” \nGirl: “Huh… That’s pretty neat.” \nAlien: “No, I would consider it rather primitive in some ways.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “As an addition, being a body of information, I do not necessarily need a physical body.” \nAlien: “But the body of information has its pros and cons.” \nAlien: “While it’s incredibly efficient at transmitting, collecting, and processing data with others of my species, it of course makes it difficult to communicate with species who have not undergone the same change.” \nAlien: “Improvements are being made with regards to this even now, so it is a problem that could vanish with time…” \nAlien: “But at the present moment, when communicating with other species, we use a “meat puppet” to serve as our information transmitter. A very primitive method.“ \nGirl: “Meat puppet?” \nAlien: “It is, in fact, the form you see before your eyes.” \nGirl: “Huh? What?” \nAlien: “To me, this body is borrowed. If I prepared another body, I could transfer to that one. And if this body is damaged, I would not die myself.” \nAlien: “However, we still have our individual preferences. So I picked a meat puppet according to my own tastes.” \nAlien: “What do you think? It somewhat resembles a popular female model… Do you find it at least a little cute?” \nGirl: “Wha?” \nAlien: “Wha?” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “I’m home! I had lunch with my friend today!” \nAlien: “Welcome home. That’s great to hear.” \nAlien: “Indeed, I did monitor many warm emotions of “joy” and “fun.”“ \nGirl: “Heehee. I’m kind of happy you came…” \nAlien: “However, I did also observe “tension”… or perhaps “disorientation.”“ \nGirl: “Ah…” \nGirl: “Well, actually… a boy confessed to me.” \nAlien: “Oho.” \nGirl: “It’s the first time it’s ever happened to me, so I wasn’t sure what to do…” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “What to do? Is it not acceptable to mate with a partner you’re fond of?” \nGirl: “Huh?” \nAlien: “If possible, I would like you to engage in intercourse with him.” \nAlien: “I pray he can become your boyfriend. That way, you would be happy, as would I for gathering enough emotion.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…Oh.” \nGirl: “I tooold yooou…” \nAlien: “W-Wait a mo -” \nGirl: “I KEEP TELLING YOU NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT!!” *POKEPOKEPOKEPOKEPOKE!!!* \nAlien: “Ah! Ow! It hurts! I was careless! Just careless!” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “You’re sure full of yourself for all your body of information stuff… but you still seem pretty dumb to me.” \nAlien: “I’m only using the minimum amount of energy to sustain myself, so it’s to be expected, sadly.” \nGirl: “Hmph.” \nAlien: “Don’t cast such doubt on me, please.” \nAlien: “While our species does have individual preferences, in order to share in information accumulation and processing, we are all equally intelligent.” \nAlien: “On the other hand, the homogeneity of intelligence does limit the tastes we can have, so differences in hobbies and such are rather slight.” \nAlien: “One could easily say that one failing of the body of information is a lack of diversity.” \nGirl: “Huh… So if your preferences are limited, wouldn’t it be a problem if you liked a boy?” \nAlien: “No, our sexual emotions have lessened greatly. It’s something only a very small group of us enjoy, even in private.” \nAlien: “As I said before, our reproduction does not require a physical body, so our sexual desires and other base desires have deteriorated.” \nAlien: “When sexual want dwindles, so does affection. Incidentally, so have appetite and sleepiness.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Huh… So then what desires do you still have?” \nAlien: “There are a variety, but for the most part… A desire to live, and a thirst for knowledge.” \nGirl: “Wow, weird. So you don’t want to eat anymore, but you’ve still got the basic desire to live.” \nAlien: “That’s simply a limitation of living beings.” \nAlien: “As long as they are living, they cannot help but seek their own continuation.” \nAlien: “Intellectual analysis into the phenomenon of life has told us that we cannot overcome the reality of being living organisms.” \nGirl: “Hmm. But that seems so boring. You’re a girl, right? And yet you’ve… never had and never will have a boy you like?” \nAlien: “Yes. But I don’t think that’s especially unfortunate.” \nAlien: “I just think of it as a duty to leave behind descendants and pass down my information. I am sure many of my kind are the same way.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “As such, I cannot very well discuss your romance with you. I apologize.” \nGirl: “It’s not like I was expecting that from you…” \nAlien: “With a fair amount of energy, I could consult a shared database for pertinent advice, but of course…” \nGirl: “I told you, it’s fine.” \nGirl: “Either way, though… boys are kind of scary. I had to turn down his offer to date.” \nAlien: “I see. That’s unfortunate.” \nGirl: “Why are you so beat up abo… never mind, don’t answer that.” \nAlien: “Ah, no, it’s not just about mating.” \nAlien: “Enjoying oneself in romance would be very effective for gathering emotions such as joy and fun. That’s why I think it’s unfortunate.” \nGirl: “Sorry about that, then. But people can’t just change in a night.” \nAlien: “Yes, well, I’m in no real hurry. I’ll be patient.” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nAlien: “What happened today?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Did something happen with your father and mother?” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “I observed a fear greater than any before it.” \nAlien: “If it lasted too long at that strength, it could have a serious effect on your life.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…..Dad…” \nGirl: “…..Dad said to come in the bath with him…” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “The bath?

It’s as I explained before, yes? The responsibility for an action lies with the one who acts.” \nAlien: “Of course, this rule does have exceptions.” \nAlien: “There is not always a direct match between the one taking the action and the one responsible for it. Even if they are not actively doing it, they could be passively responsible.” \nAlien: “But in today’s case, I will act of my own accord. Even if you were the origin behind my action, you take no responsibility for it.” \nAlien: “Even if I eliminate those that torment you, you have no reason to be distressed by it.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…” *sniff* \nGirl: “You still can’t…” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “If I agreed to that, I’d definitely think I’m responsible…” \nGirl: “Even if you really don’t consider me being involved at all, I’d definitely FEEL responsible.” \nAlien: “But…” \nGirl: “It’s… not about logic.” \nAlien: “…But then what will you do?” \nGirl: “There’s nothing that can be done. I’ve said that.” \nAlien: “…” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…I’m home.” \nAlien: “You’ve been feeling calm at school lately, but… something must have happened today.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “You were shaken by the same fear and sadness as before.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “My friend… called me a traitor.” \nAlien: “…What do you mean?” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “The boy who I told you confessed to me before…” \nAlien: “Yes, you refused his offer to date.” \nGirl: “…Yeah.” \nGirl: “It turns out my friend liked that boy.” \nAlien: “Hm.” \nGirl: “So when my friend found out he had confessed to me…” \nGirl: “She said “You traitor!”“ \nAlien: ”??? I don’t understand.“ \nAlien: “If you had accepted his offer and dated him without telling your friend, then I could see how she would interpret that as traitorous, but…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…Then she said she was only my friend because she felt bad for me. But I was filth for being confessed to by the boy she liked.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “…I see. Yes, I see.” \nGirl: “Am I really… a traitor?” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…You had no intention of deceiving her with regard to the matter of the boy.” \nAlien: “But perhaps she feels you betrayed her expectations.” \nGirl: “Expectations?” \nAlien: “Yes. I have little to go off of, but I believe she was looking down on you.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “She was counting on you to be “a girl more pathetic than me,” “a girl more misfortunate than me.”“ \nAlien: “But the boy she held affection for chose not her, but the girl whom she thought was pathetic compared to her.” \nAlien: “In his doing so, you were no longer more pathetic than her. You betrayed her expectation.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…I see.” \nAlien: “With expectations such as those, it seems a forgone conclusion that she would feel you betrayed her.” \nAlien: “But objectively speaking, it is hard indeed to label you as a traitor.” \nGirl: “…Why?” \nAlien: “In establishing a friendship with her, it is not as if you entered a contract stating to always be more pathetic than her.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Additionally, she never spoke her desire for you to remain pathetic. And given the values of your species, it is hard to claim it is easily assumed.” \nAlien: “An expectation to not be recklessly violent, to not talk behind one’s back - those are more reasonable expectations in your culture. But hers is not so.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “…If it’s too hard to understand, I’ll say it plainly.” \nAlien: “You’ve done nothing wrong.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “But… I hurt her.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “She had selfish expectations of you.” \nAlien: “And she’s merely lamenting that these did not come true.” \nAlien: “Hopes and dejection exist solely in one’s own world, so she can easily be said to have sole responsibility.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “You are not responsible for it. You did nothing wrong.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…I don’t think “responsibility” is something that comes from someone, then eventually just disappears.“ \nAlien: “Hm?” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Someone does something, there’s automatically someone responsible, something is done to make up for it, and the responsibility is gone… I don’t think that’s how it works.” \nGirl: “Maybe responsibility is just something you “take on.”“ \nAlien: “Take on?” \nGirl: “Yeah… I don’t know how to explain it. But… it’s about being resolute.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “If you’re not resolved to deal with the consequences of an evil act, then you’re not taking responsibility.” \nGirl: “When you insult someone, or kill someone… If you’re looking away from the reality of it, then you’re not resolute… you’re not taking responsibility. You’re just… irresponsible.” \nGirl: “But conversely, even when doing something that you’d consider just…” \nGirl: “If you’re willing to accept it as one of your own problems, then you’re taking responsibility.” \nGirl: “So I think responsibility is just a form of resolution…” \nAlien: “…” \n \n#2ch \nWas anyone expecting this story to be this deep? \n \n#OP \nAlien: “Perhaps what you’re talking about is not responsibility itself, but a sense of responsibility?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Hmm… no. I don’t think so…” \nGirl: “Let’s say someone does a bad thing, someone else calls it bad, and they forcibly enact punishment.” \nGirl: “But if the person who gets punished treats the consequences of their action and the punishment as just a passing breeze, then of course, they’re not being responsible.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “The people around might say they took their punishment, and as such, they’ve taken responsibility…” \nGirl: “But… I personally wouldn’t say they’ve actually done that.” \nGirl: “Because from beginning to end, they haven’t been willing to accept the responsibility they should.” \nGirl: “It’s just like they were punished for reasons unrelated to their deed.” \nAlien: “…Hm.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “What you’re saying makes logical sense. I’m not at fault for what she thinks.” \nGirl: “But putting reason aside… I’m still going to take responsibility for the reality of hurting her.” \nGirl: “Regardless of my intent, I’m the one who led her to say those things…” \nGirl: “So I do think I’m responsible for betraying her after all.” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “If you say so, then I won’t say any more.” \nAlien: “But isn’t that a harsh way to live?” \nGirl: “…Maybe it is.” \nAlien: “Even while there are no faults in your thought process, it results in you taking responsibility that you need not burden yourself with.” \nAlien: “I would say it’s very inflexible, and so narrow as to give no regard to your own well-being.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…..I’m going to bed.” \nAlien: “…Right. Good night.” \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “Welcome home.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “The color of your fear gets thicker day by day.” \nGirl: “…” \nAlien: “If it’s this bad, perhaps you shouldn’t go to school?” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…I want friends.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “…” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Hey.” \nAlien: “What?” \nGirl: “Do you have friends?” \nAlien: “…Hm.” \nAlien: “There are some whom I frequently exchange information with… but I’m sure you wouldn’t deign to call them friends.” \nGirl: “…I see.” \nGirl: “So you… don’t have any friends either.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “Heehee… hee…” \nAlien: “Why do you look happy?” \nGirl: “…Never mind.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Sigh…” \nAlien: “…I’m worried for the weakening of your life force.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Or are you just worried your emotional power supply will go away?” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “…I’m sorry.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “My mom’s calling.” \nAlien: “Yes.

I haven’t had much time to lately, but I like reading all kinds of books, not just novels.” \nAlien: “Yes, I see. Now I understand why you have such an extensive vocabulary for your age.” \nGirl: “When I’m reading… that’s when I feel peaceful.” \nGirl: “When I can empathize with the characters in a fictional world, I forget about the bad things.” \n \n#OP \nAlien: “What kind of story is the one you’re reading?” \nGirl: “This one… it’s about a girl who meets an alien.” \nAlien: “Huh?” \nGirl: “One day, an alien suddenly visits a girl.” \nGirl: “The alien looks very strange, but it doesn’t seem mean or anything…” \nGirl: “Gradually, the girl and the alien get to know each other and become friends.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “Heehee.

Not some figment of my imagination.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “I have to take responsibility for my actions.” \nGirl: “So I thought… I’d want to die.” \nAlien: “…” \nGirl: “Maybe there’s a better way of taking responsibility for something like that.” \nGirl: “But this… this is my way.” \nGirl: “I’m willing to accept that “form of resolution.”“ \n \n#OP \nAlien: “I see…” \nGirl: “…Yes.” \nAlien: “I have no right to deny your resoluteness.” \nGirl: “…Yes.” \nAlien: “So I suppose I’ll leave you here.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “I see.” \nAlien: “Indeed. With enough power to make communications, I’ll contact my mothership, and they’ll come to pick me up.” \nGirl: “So then this is goodbye…” \nAlien: “…Yes.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “It didn’t last very long…” \nGirl: “And you were just a figment of my imagination… but I enjoyed my time with you.” \nAlien: “…Yes.” \nGirl: “Thank you. I’m really grateful.” \nAlien: “No… I thank you for assisting in sustaining me and powering my ship.” \nGirl: “Hee, to the very end… you don’t let up with your act. My fantasies are pretty good.” \nAlien: “…I don’t suppose we’ll meet again.” \nGirl: “Yeah. Bye-bye… miss imaginary alien…” \nAlien: “So long… ill-fortuned girl.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…She really vanished in an instant.” \nGirl: “No trace… like a mirage.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…So long.” \nGirl: “So I was all alone from beginning to end…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Dad, mom…” \nGirl: “Did dad and mom… ever love me…?” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Mom… she hated me.” \nGirl: “And dad’s love wasn’t an ordinary fatherly love…” \nGirl: “But I…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “I loved them.” \nGirl: “…Even now I… still love them…” *sob* \nGirl: “So…” *sniff* \nGirl: “If I go to heaven, I hope we can get along…” \nGirl: “Just the three of us, starting all over…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…No, I suppose not. I’m going to hell for sure…” *sniff* \n \n#OP \n…..ah, the world is so cruel. \n \n…..full of such harsh realities. \n \n…..at least… \n \n…..at least, in this sleep… \n \n…..I hope I can be at peace… \n \n…..so long… \n \n…..bye-bye, miss alien. \n \n \n \n#OP \n…………… \n \n………. \n \n….. \n \n…se. \n \nGirl: “…” \n \n…please. \n \nGirl: “…uh…” \n \n…Wake up, please! \n \nGirl: “…..Huh?” \nAlien: “Wake up, please!

Stay with me!!” \nGirl: “…..y…” \nAlien: “Hm?” \nGirl: “…..why… would you do that for me?” \nAlien: “…” \nAlien: “…Why.

I’ll get you aid!” \nGirl: “…It’s… …fine…” *sob* \nGirl: “…At least… I made such a… good friend… before I died…” \nAlien: “…You will not die!” \nGirl: “Whether you’re just a fantasy… *hack*… or you exist… I don’t care which…” \nGirl: “Just, thank you…” *sob* \nGirl: “For calling me… your… friend…” \nAlien: “Wait! Stay…!” \n \n \n…..At that moment, she… expired. \n \n#2ch \nIt was all a dream! \n \n \n \nPlease tell me it was. \n \n#OP \n? Epilogue \n \nI left the planet. \nBut it was difficult to say my duty was completed. \nI contacted the mothership to pick me up, and the moment the power I had gathered was secured, I returned without permission to the planet I had just left. \n…But I could not avert her death. \nDid my hesitation determine this fate? \nThis dull regret echoes in my mind. \nCertainly… if I had given her a body of information before returning to the mothership… \nAs soon as it returned to secure the power, I would have been executed instantly. \nUltimately, I must convince myself that this was the only possible outcome. \nThere’s… no going back to the past. \n \n#OP \nWhat to do now? \nI could not share the experience with my fellow bodies of information. \nIf I did, certainly a third party would lecture me on what should have been done in my position. \n…Should I return to my birthplace? \nThinking this, I took the helm. \n…My space ship cruises outrageously fast. \nWhile I call it a space ship, it’s not as if it’s a physical ship I ride on. \nIt is little more than another body of information. \nIn the process of such abstract aviation… I wonder now if I’m moving forward or running away. \n“Responsibility…” \nIt floats alone in my consciousness. \nWhy, even now… does my meeting with her circle my mind? \n \n#OP \n………. \n \n….. \n \n… \n \n…Communication trouble rendered me unable to return to the mothership, and I’d run out of power. \nI knew I would be able to make it to the target planet, so I looked at the situation optimistically. \nNot thinking about things too seriously has always differentiated me from others of my kind. \n“Still, I suppose I can’t just go out for a leisurely stroll…” \nGenerally, I would want to prepare a meat puppet that would aid in contact with the races of this planet, but I had no energy for such a thing. \nSo, with no other choice, I created a meat puppet that imitated the form of our ancient ancestors. \nIt wasn’t easy to act in such a form. \nIf I were to walk down the street as such, I would no doubt draw attention and soon be dissected. \nOf course, dissection of this body wouldn’t mean the end of me. \n \n#OP \nAt present, I had a need to find an inhabitant to assist in collecting emotions. \n \n“Who are you?” \n \n…I found one before I could even begin my search. \n \n“Er, I’m an alien.” \nOut with the truth immediately. I’m honest to a fault. \n“Wow…” \nShe had a sparkle in her eyes. \n“It’s always been my dream to be friends with an alien!” \n…Hoh. \n“Well, I’m glad as well to meet a source of… cough, ahem… make a friend on this planet!” \nSo I followed her, thinking only what an innocent creature she was. \n \n#OP \n“Hey… How do aliens live?” \n \n…I immediately noticed something upon entering her home. \nA rotten smell… the smell of corpses. \n \n“Well, it may be very different from what you’re imagining…” \n \nThe smell’s coming from… the first floor… the bathroom? \n \n“I have to say… You sure look weird. Are all aliens like this?” \n“No, not exactly. In fact, I’m just borrowing this. It’s not my regular form.” \n“Hm? What do you mean?” \n \n…Doesn’t she notice this smell? \nIf she does, she’s not paying it any mind… \nContinuing to talk to her, I couldn’t help but be curious about the smell and grew absent-minded. \n \n#OP \n“Can I borrow your toilet?” \n“Huh?! O-Okay… Aliens use the toilet?” \n“Yes… we do.” \n \n…a lie, of course. \nI went down to the first floor and checked the bathroom. \nI found two rotten corpses. \n \n“…Hm.” \n \nCould there be cultures that kept the corpses of family members in the bathroom? \n \n“I doubt that…” \n \nAfter some data processing, I returned to her room on the second floor. \n \n#OP \n“Welcome back.” \n“Ah, hi.” \n \nShe was relaxing in her room. \n \n“Er… Can I ask you something?” \n“What?” \n“What are the corpses in the bathroom?” \n“…” \n“?” \n“…” \n“Err…” \n \n…S-She fainted. \nWhat’s with this girl…? \n \n#OP \n“Who are you?” \n \nThat was her first question upon waking up. \n \n“Er, I’m an alien.” \n \nEven I find replying so honestly a little… hm. Deja vu. \n \n“An alien?” \n“Yes.” \n \n…Ah, I see. \nThis girl must be insane. \nDeciding this, I simultaneously thought… “Won’t this be convenient, though?” \nShe was rather odd the moment she accepted the existence of aliens without hesitation. \nBut for one with an objective of gathering emotions, it seemed to make things easier for me. \nAnd such is how I chose her as my target. \n \n………. \n \n….. \n \n… \n \n#OP \nTo begin with, I merely used her. \nEven after discovering her unhappy circumstances and still-unhappy delusions, I felt no particular sympathy. \nThe Bully Termination Plan was only a way to keep her life force from weakening. \nIf she had agreed to the plan, I was thinking I could manipulate her fantasies in an agreeable way. \nOf course, to do that, some way or another, I would have to falsify the “deaths” of her parents and classmates. \nIf the ill treatment were not an illusion, but something happening in reality, I could do as I told her I would and murder them… \nBut unable to do such a thing with figments of her imagination, I came to worry about her progression. \n…Yes, I truly did worry about her. \nA large part of which arose from her way of thinking. \n \n#OP \n…..Responsibility is a form of resolution. \nIt should have been a young girl’s joke, a remark to be laughed at. \nBut what brought about a change in me was… her words. \nRidiculous as it was, I found something somehow beautiful about the way she accepted responsibility for her ill treatment in her fantasies. \nIt’s a sentiment that should have died off in our species. \nAnd yet, her resoluteness… it tugged at my heartstrings, and shook my soul. \nAnd when I saw her resolution to close the curtain on her own life, ultimately taking responsibility for the murder of her parents… \nI was assaulted with a strong urge to protect her, this beautiful creature. \n \n#OP \nWhen we stand at a crossroads, we have a habit of making our decision by judging what we will gain. \nIn doing this, we tend to forget what will we lose from our choice. \nAnd after proceeding ahead without regard to what we’ve lost, even the reality of losing ourselves lands in forgotten oblivion. \nStanding as we are now at the end of countless forgotten decisions, we come to worry about our journey, wondering if the choices we made were right. \nWhen we begin to doubt, we cannot move forward. \nSo my fellows do not feel doubt, never stopping, unafraid of forgetting, and proceed bravely ahead. \n…..Yes. \nI did little more than take a different path from them. \n \n#OP \nThey had a sense of dignity once, now left to the distant past. \nAnd I had emotion for that girl that welled up in my chest and shook my core. \nSo I stubbornly chose what my fellows had forgotten, and chose to be left behind. \n……….Was there value in doing so? \nI need not ask. \n \n…Warm. \n…Gentle. \n…Full of courage. \n…More precious than anything………. \n \n \nGirl: “…..Hey. Don’t look so gloomy and thoughtful, talk to me!” \nAlien: “Huh…? Ah, sorry. Well, what shall we talk about?” \n \n…..There’s nothing that could be more important than protecting this girl and her smile. \n \n#OP \n*** \n \nGirl: “Hnnnnngh!!” \nGirl: “…Haaah!! Finally, land at last!” \nAlien: “It was a long trip.” \nGirl: “It sure was! It’s so boring in your spaceship. You can’t walk, can’t eat…” \nAlien: “Well, you have a body of information now, so there’s no need for exercise or food, right?” \nAlien: “Of course, in exchange, you now need emotional energy like us.” \nGirl: “…Well, that’s fine. But what’s with this body?” \nAlien: “It’s a meat puppet modeled after our ancient ancestors. The same kind I was using.” \nGirl: “…I prefer my old body.” \nAlien: “Just put up with it, please. That body is… undeniably dead, after all.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “About that. Every time I hear it, I still don’t get it… I died?” \nAlien: “You certainly met your death as a regular lifeform.” \nAlien: “But the termination of the body and of life are separate phenomena.” \nAlien: “When they are linked, then the destruction of the body carries life with it.” \nAlien: “But I, and now you, have our lives as a body of information, so the death of a physical body will not terminate us.” \nAlien: “Of course, life itself has a lifespan separate from the body, so having a body of information doesn’t mean living forever either.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…Nope, I don’t think I’ll ever understand. Can you summarize?” \nAlien: “Hm. To be concise…” \nAlien: “After your physical body was dead, after a slight delay, I was able to make your life a body of information, as it did not itself expire.” \nAlien: “The loss of your physical body is lamentable, though.” \nAlien: “I regret not being able to do anything more about it.” \nGirl: “Well… whatever. It’s fine, I guess.” \nAlien: “…So, then I was able to have you board my ship, and after our trip… we’ve now arrived at my birthplace.” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “Yeah, I don’t get it.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…But I have to say, I’m liking this planet.” \nGirl: “Lots of greenery, lots of water. Air’s… a little stale, but I guess I’ll get used to it.” \nAlien: “I’m glad you like it.” \nAlien: “In the past, there used to be crust and climate change, and the deforestation and resource mining we ourselves did was terrible indeed, but many years of effort have improved things greatly.” \nAlien: “We still don’t get many extraterrestrial visitors, so you’ll be welcome… well, not treated cruelly, at least.” \nGirl: “Hmm. …You said this was your birthplace, but you weren’t really born here, were you?” \nAlien: “Yes, of course. To be exact, this is the planet where the ancestors of my species lived.” \nAlien: “The meat puppets you and I are using now are in the form of those ancestors.” \nGirl: “Hmm. Weird…” \nAlien: “Don’t worry, I’ve prepared a meat puppet for your own species as well. Just put up with it for now.” \nGirl: “…Fine. I will.” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “W-Well…? Since you were the one who took me here…” \nAlien: “? Yes, I was.” \nGirl: “T-Then… you have to take responsibility for me!” \nGirl: “I wouldn’t stand for being left all alone to wander this planet.” \nAlien: “Ah, I see. It’s fine. I’ll show you around.” \nAlien: “…But given this context, and the cultural background of your species, your comment about “taking responsibility for you”…“ \nAlien: “Is it related to marriage? Are you proposing?” \nGirl: “…Huh? What’re you talking about?” \nAlien: “Hm. Well, I’d be ready to accompany you for life, but even if you have that intention…” \nAlien: “A gender barrier stands in the way of procreation… er… well, a much bigger one of species…” *mumble* \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Hey, what are you mumbling about? …It’s making me uneasy.” \nAlien: “…Yes, I understand. It’s fine.” \nGirl: “Huh? What is?” \nAlien: “While it’s impossible for us to create children due to the species difference, it will not frustrate you.” \nGirl: “Huh…?” \nAlien: “What? There’s nothing to be anxious about. While sexual desire is a faded one for us, there are those among us who enjoy it for the ecstasy, so you…” \nGirl: “…” \nGirl: “…You reeeally…” \nAlien: “?” \nGirl: “Don’t LEEEEEARN!!!” *POKEPOKEPOKEPOKEPOKEPOKE!!!* \nAlien: “Ah! Ow! That hurts! But it’s so nostalgic! But it hurts!” \nGirl: “Again! Why are you enjoying it?! Stupid!” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “Sheesh. You never learn.” \nAlien: “Hee… sorry.” \nGirl: “…Well, don’t we need to get going?” \nAlien: “Yes, let’s go.” \nGirl: “…Argh, but it’s just… so hard to walk!!” \nAlien: “I apologize. You’ll just have to get used to it.” \nGirl: “How can you manage getting around in this body?!” \nAlien: “Practice, really.” \nGirl: “I mean, seriously…” \nGirl: “How can you… HOW CAN YOU ONLY HAVE TWO LEGS?! This is just common SENSE!” \n \n#2ch \nHuh? \n \n#2ch \nSay what? \n \n#2ch \nA plot twist this late…? \n \n#OP \nAlien: “That’s how our ancestors’ bodies were. Not much I can do about that.” \nGirl: “Not just two legs, but two arms! It’s so inconvenient!” \nGirl: “And everything’s all tall and vertical, so the center of gravity is all unstable!” \nGirl: “And what the hell is this fluffy stuff at the top?!” \nAlien: “It’s called “hair.” Yours is long, black, and straight. It really suits you.“ \nAlien: “Your eyes are cute and round as well, and they fit well with the bridge of your nose… Indeed, you look very beautiful.” \nAlien: “While I did pick a short build to match your age… that body would be very popular among meat puppet enthusiasts of our race.” \nGirl: “Don’t try and tell me that. Weird things are weird and they’re going to feel weird!” \nGirl: “….Man. I miss my old body…” \nAlien: “Heehee… Just deal with it for a little while, alright?” \n \n#OP \nGirl: “…Hey. I forgot to ask you something important.” \n \nShe turned her head, her long hair trailing behind her. \n \nAlien: “What is it?” \nGirl: “This planet. What’s it called?” \n \nWhatever the form, her strength and the sparkle in her eyes didn’t change. \n \nAlien: “Huh? Didn’t I tell you at the start?” \nGirl: “Maybe, but I guess I forgot.” \n \nStanding side by side, both looking with resolution toward their future, all they needed was their hope. \n \nAlien: “Heehee… Is that so?” \nAlien: “This planet, birthplace of my ancestors…..” \n \n \n \n \nAlien: “……………is named “Earth.” Wonderful name, isn’t it?“ \n \n#OP \n? Girl: “Who are you?” Alien: “Er, I’m an alien.” fin.",

                    Content = "#OP \nIn the house, there was a stunningly gigantic boulder. \nHowever, consider that the rock was there to begin with, and the house was made to contain it. \n \nThe rock had a rope wound around it. \nAnd though no one knew where on the rock the rope came out from, the rope was connected to a girl. \n \nNo axe or saw in any man’s hand could cut the rope. \nSo the girl could not move more than a few meters from the rock. \nFor that reason, it was felt that a house had to be made there. \n \n#OP \nThe rope grew out of the girl’s back, so wearing clothes over it would feel itchy. \nThus, all the girl’s clothes had a big slit cut out from the neck to the back. \n \nShe slept face-down. \nShe held the rope with her left hand for slack, and fiddled with it with her right. \n \nHer most treasured possession was a telescope her father had bought for her. \nWhen she tired of reading, she would use it to peer outside. \nShe could rarely see any more than snow and trees, but she looked very closely. \n \n#2ch \nHuh? \nShe has a rope… growing out of her…? \n \n#OP \nWith no opportunity to go outside, the girl was rather naïve. \nShe herself was mindful of this, and so she read many books. \n \nThe girl did household chores, was considerate, and made no complaint about the strange rope growing out of her back. \nHer family became quite used to the lifestyle. \n \n#2ch \nComing up with all this just from seeing a rope tied around a rock… Not bad. \n \n#OP \nOne day, there was a fierce snowstorm. \nThe girl peered outside with her telescope as usual, and sighted something moving. \nIt trudged through the snow, falling over after every couple of steps. She presumed it was a human. \n \nThe figure seemed to be in great pain, so the girl wanted to do something to help. \nBut as the rope prevented her from leaving the house, she could merely wait for her parents. \n \n#OP \nThe rope was of a length just too short for her to exit the house. \nOr to be more accurate, the house was built of a size just too big for the rope. \n \nPerhaps her parents considered that if she could only go just a tiny distance outside, it was better that she couldn’t reach outside at all. \n \n#OP \nThe girl waited by an open window and called to the person outside. \nShe didn’t know if they could hear her, but she called again and again until her parents returned. \nShe enjoyed talking to people. \n \n#OP \nLeaning on the shoulder of her father, the person was brought into the house. \nHe was freezing, but seemed alright. \n \nUpon taking off his heavy snow clothes, the girl realized he was about the same age as she. \n \n#OP \n“You saved my life,” the boy said. \nThe girl’s father brought him warm soup. \nHe took the bowl with shivering hands, and he thanked him. \n \nThe boy seemed sick with something, so the girl’s mother warned her to keep her distance. \nBut the girl had no intention of listening to her mother. \n \nIt was more or less the first time she’d met someone her own age, after all. \n \n#OP \nThe boy said that he wasn’t contagious. \nThe girl’s father seemed to know the sickness by name, as well. \n \nHe seemed to be telling the truth. \nUnless you were deathly weak, it was a sickness that hardly showed itself. \nThough if it was showing symptoms, it was already incurable. \n \n#OP \nThe boy thanked her father again. \nBut he said, “No, I knew to come help because she noticed you. Give your thanks to her,” indicating his daughter. \n \nThe girl was fiddling with the rope as usual. \n“Dad had to go because I couldn’t do anything myself,” she smiled. \n“So you should thank dad.” \n \n#OP \nWhat a nice family. \n \nThe boy saw the rock. \nWhat was something like that doing in a house? \n \nAnd then the rope coming from the rock. \nWhy was that wrapped around it? \n \nAnd then, the girl at the end of the rope. \nHis gaze moved to her back. \n \n#OP \nHe could see her pretty, pale back clearly through the big slit in her clothes. \nThe boy quickly looked away, his face heating up. \n \n“Maybe you need a rope for a girl this cute,” the boy thought. \nNo, no, that’s just silly. \n \nBut he had a general understanding. \nThe rope wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. \n \n#OP \nThe girl’s mother explained the rope to the boy. \nApparently she enjoyed talking about it. \nPerhaps because a doctor had told her that the rock was a god. \n \nIndeed, the rock was a sort of guardian deity in the area, and so the girl was said to be chosen by God. \nSounds a bit shady, if you ask me. \n \n#OP \nOnce he was done with his soup, the boy talked to the girl. \n \nDo you want to go outside? \n \nThe girl nodded repeatedly. \n \nI do. \n \nThough in truth, they both felt like it was something they shouldn’t have said. \n \n#OP \nThe boy unsteadily rose from the chair and walked over to the girl. \nHe fell over. The girl ran over to him. \n \nThe boy rose from the floor and reached for the girl’s back. \nHer body stiffened. “What?”, she asked. \n \n#OP \nAs soon as the boy grabbed the rope, as if losing its energy, it went limp. \nWhen the girl pulled on the rope, it stretched out. \n \n“These are the limits,” the boy said to her parents. \n“I can’t cut it, but I can stretch it.” \nHe turned to the girl and asked. \n \nDo you want to go outside? \n \n#OP \nThe girl nodded again and again. \nHer mother was going to stop her, but her father stopped her in turn. \n \nThe boy still holding the rope, he opened the door and went out. \nAnd the girl set foot outside. \n \n#OP \nThe girl, who had not spent two seconds outside and wore clothes with a big hole in the back, trudged slowly around the mountain with snow piled up to her hips. \n \nShe figured she might never get such an opportunity again. \n \n#OP \nThe girl looked up at a tree and touched the trunk. \n“It’s rugged,” the girl said. \nJust then, a branch above gave in to the weight of the snow, and a pile of snow dropped on her head. \n \n“C-C-Cold!”, the girl shivered, hurrying away from the tree. \nShe collided with the boy, who was running over to help her with the snow. \n \n#OP \nThe boy released his hand from the rope, and instantly, the rope returned to normal. \nHe hurried after the girl. \n \nThe rope had pulled the girl along, slamming her into a tree, then got caught on a branch. \n \n#OP \nWhile the girl bled slightly from her forehead, she looked up at the tree she’d collided with. \n \nThe boy was beside himself with worry. \n“I’m so sorry! Are you okay?”, he asked. \nThe girl replied entirely too happily, “I got hurt!” \n \n#OP \n“It’s just like something out of a book.” \n \n“What is?” \n \n“Getting injured by slamming into a tree.” \n \n“No, books imitate reality. \nSomeone in real life slammed into a tree, so that’s why someone wrote it in a book. Reality came first.” \n \n“Well. To me, though, it’s like being in a book.” \n \n#OP \nThe two went back to the house to treat the girl. \nHer parents were flustered when they saw her wounded, but the girl kept a smile throughout. \nWhen she met eyes with the boy, she lowered her head. \n \nOut of breath, the boy thought, “Oh, man…” \nBecause he’d gotten her hurt in under an hour. \n \n#OP \nOnce her treatment was done, the girl said, “Pull! Pull!” \n \n#OP \nFrom then on, the two would periodically go on walks together. \n \nHer parents were beyond worried by the idea of their daughter going on walks with a wizard boy with an incurable disease. \nBut as discomforting as it was to them, they could say nothing in the face of her delight. \n \nSo that’s how our daughter smiles, huh. \n \n#OP \n“What’s that?” \n \n“That’s a fox.” \n \n“How far out can we go?” \n \n“I don’t know. It might be up to you, or up to me too.” \n \n“So, what other fancy things can you do?” \n \n“Well, I can’t do anything else while I’m stretching the rope.” \n \n“Is stretching the rope that hard?” \n \n“I wouldn’t be surprised if I was the only one who could do it,” the boy replied. \n \nOf course, he really just hoped he was the only one. \n \n#OP \n“Oh, a fox!” \n \n“That’s a person.” \n \n“Oh. That’s a person, then.” \n \n“It’s going to be hard leaving the forest…” \n \n“Yeah… I guess it’s not possible to walk to town?” \n \n“Either way, I can’t go to town.” \n \n“Why not?” \n \n“Because the people there don’t like me.” \n \n“Hmm. Would they allow a person attached to a rope in?” \n \n“Who knows.” Perhaps not. \n \n#OP \n“So they don’t let wizards into town?” \n \n“Wizard, huh? Who said I was a wizard?” \n \n“Well, is there anyone else who can do things like this?” \n \n“True, I guess I am a wizard. \nBut it’s not that wizards aren’t allowed in town. \nRather, people not allowed in town might become wizards. I guess.” \n \n“But I can’t use magic.” \n \n“Then maybe you can go into town.” \n \n“Hooray!” \n \n#OP \n“You fell again. Are you okay?” \n \n“I just tripped. It’s no big deal.” \n \n“What’s your sickness like?” \n \n“Sometimes I just lose feeling, that’s all.” \nThough this had been happening increasingly often. \n \n“Hmm. Right.” \n \n“Right what?” \n \n“When that happens, I’ll pull to help you out.” \n \n“Err… thanks.” \n \n“Oh, right. Yeah. Thanks to you, too.” \n \n#OP \n“You know, I wish I’d gotten to know you sooner.” \n \n“So you could go outside sooner, yeah.” \n \n“Well, there’s that, but…” \n \n“Something else?” \n \n“I’ve never been able to make friends with any other people my age.” \n \n“Same here.” To be precise, he meant making friends with people in particular. \n \n“Of course, if I didn’t have the rope, then…” \n \nThen perhaps they wouldn’t have ended up friends. \nThe boy was glad for the rope, sorry as he was to feel that way. \n \n#OP \nThe girl not knowing much at all, she was excited by just about anything. \nAs she walked through the snowy forest she had never had a clear view of, the trees, the snow, the stars through the branches, all brought her joy. \nEven if there was little in the way of things she had truly never seen. \n \nShe had never seen trees from below, so she enjoyed it. \nDifficult to understand, perhaps. \nAnd she enjoyed how there was so much snow to walk through. \nA little easier to understand. \n \n#OP \n“Um… You know, it’s really amazing seeing the branches swaying and stars twinkling when you look up.” \n \n“Yeah. It’s really great.” \n \n“But the light from the town is even more amazing. \nCan we really not go there?” \n \n“When spring comes and the snow melts, maybe we can.” \n \n“I wonder if that can happen soon…” \n \n“I hope it does.” \n \n#OP \n“If he comes by the house again, turn him away.” \n \nThese, too, were words uttered with the girl’s feelings in mind. \n \n#OP \nThe boy came to visit the girl as usual, but was told by her father, “Unfortunately, you can’t meet with her today.” \nHe was told the same thing his next visit, and the next. \n \n“Did something happen?” \n“Our daughter is sick.” \n \n#OP \nThe boy thought on his way back. \nWhy can’t I meet with her? \nHer father told me she was sick. \n \n“Sick?”, he thought. My sickness? \nIt doesn’t show symptoms until you’re close to death. \n \nBut what about her? \nYou can’t think of her like a normal girl, can you? \n \n#OP \nAnd is the reason her parents are unwilling to let me see her because they don’t want me to see her with my sickness? \nOr is it her own wish that I’m not to meet with her again? \n \n#OP \nNow, he began to recall her devout mother. \nShe had always considered the rock as a god. \n \nShortly after the girl was born, she was somehow attached to the rope while her parents weren’t looking. \nThis baffling occurrence led the townspeople to consider her a child of ill omen. \n \n#OP \nThen a doctor appeared - or rather, a priest. \nThanks to his shady story, the girl was overlooked. Guardian deity this and that. \nHer parents were delighted. Their daughter was saved. \n \n#OP \nWho knows if the priest truly believed his own story. \nBut the girl’s mother had taken it very seriously. \n \nThinking about all this together, could using enigmatic magic to extend the rope connecting the deity rock and the girl beyond its original length be considered sacrilege? \n \nAnd rumors about the boy had reached the girl’s father. \nRumors about how he was driven out of town for using mysterious arts. \nNo, he thought, I shouldn’t let that boy see my daughter anymore. \n \n#OP \nThe boy thought. \nI’ve been living with this sickness, and if she has the same thing, it can’t be long now for me. \n \nBut I had been incredibly careful to ensure that this wouldn’t happen. \nIncredibly so. \n \nYet all I did was bring ruin to her peaceful life and happy family. \n \nThe boy stopped going to the girl’s house. \nThe sickness began to advance. \n \n#OP \nThe girl could always look forward to peering outside with her telescope and seeing the boy come by. \nBut she was shocked to hear he wouldn’t be coming, and lost all interest in looking outside. \n \n“That boy isn’t coming here anymore. \nIt seems his sickness is getting worse, so he can’t make it.” \n \nIndeed, his sickness was worsening, and he couldn’t make it. Shortly after this lie was told, that is. \n \n#OP \nThe girl thought. \nWhat if mom and dad are lying to me? \n \nDid the boy lose interest in me? \nOr worse than that, maybe he hates me. \nDid I do something wrong? \nDid I make a mistake? \n \nThat can’t be it. He was glad to do what he could about the rope. \nIn fact, perhaps he paid too much of a price in doing it. \nAnd that’s why his sickness is getting worse. \n \nWhatever the case, she didn’t like it. \n \n#OP \nThe girl wanted to meet him directly to know the truth. \nBut her parents were even more worried for her than usual. \nShe thought it would be a burden on her parents to say or think anything more about the boy. \n \nSo the girl gave up questioning about the boy, and tried to act like everything was as it had been. \n \nBut she couldn’t help feeling that her rope was shorter than ever. \n \n#OP \nSometimes the boy would wake up, touch a piece of rope by his bed, and fall back asleep. \nJust a useless, ordinary piece of rope. \n \n#OP \nOnce, when snow blew in through the window her mother had opened, chilling the back of her neck, she wondered if the rope could be pruned down. \n \nWhile her parents were out working or shopping, the girl would endeavor to cut the rope. \nHer hands became covered with blisters. Seeing this, her mother was enraged. \n“The rope is holy!” \n \n#OP \n“What’s going on?!” \nIt seemed that the girl had cut away the flesh around where the rope came out. \n \n“I got hurt…” \nWhat she’d learned from doing this was that the rope was connected to her heart. \n \n#OP \nHer parents grieved. \nShe shouldn’t have learned about the outside world. \nIn exchange for temporary happiness, she was burdened with a lifetime of sorrow. \n \n#OP \nOn top of her wounds, the girl bore a terrible sickness. \nIndeed, a sickness the boy had infected her with. \nNow her parents’ lies had been fully realized. \nAnd now, just as the boy said, it wouldn’t be long. \n \n#OP \nThe girl’s parents came to visit the boy, and were surprised to see his condition much like their daughter’s. \nAt the same time, they came to understand a number of things. \n \nThe father spoke. \n“Yes, we’ve been thoughtless and foolish. \nWe’ve gone and ruined something that should have been left be.” \n \n#OP \nThe girl’s parents spoke about everything with the boy. \n“Though I know it’s very selfish to ask to see your daughter now, would you let me?” \n \nIn the next moment, the boy vanished. \nWhen the parents returned home, the girl was also nowhere to be seen. \nThe rope connected to her extended outside the house. \nWhen they followed its trail, they found it frayed halfway. \n \n \nPull.

Very often this will depend mostly on the size of the color gamut of the display, but it is also very dependent on the color space the content was captured in and the color space it was exported in. Therefore, to get a good idea of the ability of the display to represent colors true to life, it is important to know to what amount the color gamut of the display covers certain color spaces. \n \nPerhaps the most important of all color spaces would be the Pointer’s gamut. The Pointer’s gamut is an approximation of the gamut of real surface colors based on the research by dr. Michael R. Pointer. So far I haven’t been able to get my hands on the paper, but when searching for the data I did find Jeff Yurek’s blog dot-color.com. He wrote a couple of articles discussing the Pointer’s gamut and was able to provide me with the Pointer’s gamut data (which I later also found on the website of Center for Imaging Science). \n \nWith this data I was able to write a Matlab program that calculates the coverage of the Pointer’s gamut by any color space or color gamut in both the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram and the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. This also gave me the idea of writing this article to explain more. \n \n \n \nChromaticity Diagrams \n \nLet us start with how color spaces and color gamuts are defined: Every color can be divided into a chromaticity and a brightness component. The brightness component speaks for itself. The chromaticity component describes the proportion of the different wavelengths that make up the color. Chromaticity is also what defines a color space or color gamut. There are two common ways to do that: the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram and the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. \n \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \nThe full origin and derivation of the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram is beyond the scope of this text.  In short: based on the results of experiments conducted in the 1920's to quantify human color vision the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) created the CIE 1931 XYZ and CIE 1931 RGB color spaces. From the CIE 1931 XYZ color space the CIE 1931 xyY color space was derived, which separates the chromaticity part of a color (xy) from the luminance part (Y). The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram is the visualization of all different chromaticities in the xyY color space and therefore also of all chromaticities perceivable by the human eye. It is a means to describe the gamut of a color space or display by the chromaticity of its primaries. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram with Planckian locus. Click for larger version \n \n \n \nSpectral locus \n \n \nThe curve surrounding the tongue shaped area is called the spectral locus. This line represents all the monochromatic colors (colors of one wavelength, or fully saturated colors). You’ll notice that in the image above it ranges from 380 to 700 nm, however, every wavelength is on the spectral locus. It’s just that the cone cells in our retina aren’t sensitive to electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 360 nm or longer than 780 nm and the sensitivity is already negligible below 380 or above 700 nm (Figure 2). Therefore they are infinitely close together on the spectral locus, so that every wave length shorter than 360 nm will have the same chromaticity coordinates as 360 nm and every wavelength longer than 780 nm will have the same chromaticity coordinates as 780 nm. Thus adding nothing to the size of the tongue shaped area. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: The normalized spectral sensitivity of human cone cells of short-, middle- and long-wavelength types. \nClick for larger version \n \n \n \n \nLine of purples \n \n \nThe line of purples is the straight line connecting both ends of the spectral locus. While every color on the line of purples is a combination of violet (360 nm) and red (780 nm), all these colors are fully saturated. This is also the reason why you will never see a magenta primary on a display. It would be completely redundant, because it would add nothing the shades of purple that could already be reproduced by mixing violet and red. It would also be extremely hard, if not entirely impossible to make because it would require a dual band pass filter with very narrow bands. \nPlanckian locus \n \n \nThe curve inside the tongue shaped area is called the Planckian locus. The points that make up the Planckian locus are the chromaticity coordinates of the light emitted by a black body radiator of a certain temperature in Kelvin. The lines crossing the Planckian locus are the isotherms: a near black body radiator on an isotherm would have a correlated color temperature equal to the black body radiator at the intersection of the isotherm and the Planckian locus. \n \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \nThe research of David L. MacAdam (1942) showed that the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram did not offer perceptual uniformity. What this means is that the relation between the measurable chromaticity of a color and the error margin in observation, was not consistent within the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. In his experiment observers were asked to match the color of an adjustable light source with the color of a fixed reference light. This experiment showed that when mapped in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram the error margin was far greater with green hues than with blue or violet hues. \n \n \nThis is shown in Figure 3, where the dots represent the chromaticity of the test colors and the ellipses the error margin in matching the color by the observer multiplied by a factor of 10. These ellipses are called the MacAdam ellipses. In a perfectly uniform color space these ellipses would all be circles of equal size. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: MacAdam ellipses plotted in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. Click for larger version \n \n \n \n \n \nTo improve upon the CIE 1931 XYZ color space using the work of MacAdam, the CIE created the CIE 1976 L*u*v* (also known as CIELUV) color space as an attempt to offer perceptual uniformity. This color space had, like the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, a chromaticity diagram: the CIE1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram or CIE 1976 UCS (Uniform Chromaticity Scale) shown below: \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. Click for larger version \n \n \nThe CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram does seem to have a better perceptual uniformity when plotting the MacAdam ellipses in it. The size disparity is smaller and the elongation is also less prevalent (the ellipses are closer to being circles): \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: MacAdam ellipses in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are however more recent studies that question the validity of the MacAdam ellipses. Wyszecki and Fielder (1971) measured their own color-discriminating ellipses, but ended up with ellipses of different orientation, shape and size to the ones from MacAdam. Goldstein (2012) uses a different approach. He calculated the size and orientation of color-discriminating ellipses for the same test colors as MacAdam for CIE ΔE 2000 = 1 and for CIE ΔE 2000 = 3. This resulted in ellipses that were more uniform in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram than in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. Both the ratio between the major and minor axis of the most stretched ellipse and the ratio between the major axes of the longest and the shortest ellipses were higher in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. \n \n \n \nTo date the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram has been the standard. Taking into account the work of Goldstein that might not be such a bad thing. However, as often is the case in science, different methods may yield different results. The correct value isn’t necessarily the result of any method, but might as well be somewhere in between. The remainder of this article will therefore discuss everything for both the CIE 1931 xy and the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagrams. \n \n \n \n \n \nPointer’s gamut \n \n \nThe Pointer’s gamut is (an approximation of) the gamut of real surface colors as can be seen by the human eye, based on the research by Michael R. Pointer (1980). What this means is that every color that can be reflected by the surface of an object of any material is inside the Pointer’s gamut. You could therefore also say that the Pointer’s gamut is the set of colors that can be reproduced using subtractive color mixing, which is a subset of the set of colors reproducible using additive color mixing (or simply all colors). The two chromaticity diagrams discussed earlier are visualizations of the set of colors using additive color mixing. \nAdditive color mixing \n \n \nWith additive color mixing you can create a new color by mixing light of different wavelengths and varying the brightness. If for instance you were to take a light source with a wavelength of 585 nm (amber yellow) and another light source with a wavelength of 485 nm (bright azure), you could reproduce any color along the line between 585 nm and 485 nm (in any chromaticity diagram) by varying the brightness of both light sources. This also means that if the line between one pair of chromaticities crosses the line between another pair of chromaticities, those two pairs can create a color that will be perceived as identical for both pairs, but will have a different spectral distribution. This effect is called metamerism and is the foundation of color display: using different primaries across various systems to describe or reproduce colors that are perceived as identical, but with different spectral distribution. \nSubtractive color mixing \n \n \nWith subtractive color mixing, light isn’t emitted by the “source”, but only reflected. The color of any object as we perceive it is the combination of wavelengths from the light source illuminating the object (often the sun, but also artificial light sources) that is reflected by the object. All other wavelengths of the light source are absorbed by the object. \n \n \nThe reason I chose 485 and 585 nm in the example for additive mixing is that in theory you could create a very accurate daylight simulator with just these two wavelengths when comparing the chromaticity to that of a black body radiator or daylight simulator. The default white point for nearly every display panel to date is the CIE Standard Illuminant D65. This is a daylight simulator for a midday sun in Northern / Western Europe. D65 is a near black body radiator (slightly more greenish) with a correlated color temperature of 6503.6 k. In the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram it has the coordinates x = 0.31271 and y = 0.32902. By mixing light with wavelengths 485 and 585 nm, you could come very close to D65: x = 0.31271 y = 0.33076, which would have CCT of 6492 K (McCamy method). So with just these two wavelengths you could simulate daylight white when observed directly from the source. \n \n \nHowever, if you were to illuminate an object with just 485 and 585 nm light sources, the color would appear to be a combination of just these two wavelengths. If the object were to be a very saturated deep hue of green, it would appear to be (near) black, as 485 and 585 nm aren’t reflected by its surface (assuming a matte surface and no fluorescence). \nDiffuse reflection vs. specular reflection \n \n \nApart from the color quality of the light source, subtractive color mixing is also highly sensitive to surface smoothness. Pointer’s gamut is defined for diffuse reflection (matte surface). As opposed to diffuse reflection there is specular reflection, or mirror like reflection. By specular reflection objects can reflect colors that are outside the Pointer’s gamut. \n \n \nFor instance a matte black car absorbs (nearly) all light that falls on it, because it is just a diffuse reflector (not a very good one though, because it’s black). A glossy black car however would just absorb a portion of the light that falls on it, because it’s not only a diffuse reflector, but also a specular reflector. When standing next to it you would be able to see your own image in it, although highly distorted: by both the shape of the car on a large scale and the imperfectness of the glossy paint as specular reflector on a small scale. \n \n \nA better example of a reflector both diffuse and specular would be a red glossy car. Because of diffuse reflection it appears to be red, when you drive it through a green forest though it also reflects the green of the trees by specular reflection. Because both happen at the same time the green from the trees would appear a far less deep hue of green and also far less saturated in the reflection on the car than we viewed directly or in a mirror (near perfect specular reflector). At the same time the red color of the car also appears to change in hue and saturation, because the diffusely reflected red mixes with the specularly reflected green. \n \n \nJust like the red car, most metals and alloys are also both a diffuse and specular reflector. And like the car the proportion of diffuse and specular reflection is dependent on the wavelength. Silver for instance is a diffuse reflector that’s very constant for all visible wavelengths. The color of silver is therefore a darker version of the light source illuminating it; the chromaticity will be nearly identical. Gold however is only a diffuse reflector up from around 500 nm, for shorter wavelengths it only reflects specularly. This is why gold has the color as we know it. For copper the same applies, but with an even longer wavelength as threshold: about 570 nm. \n \n \nIn a way that’s quite similar to an object being both a diffuse and specular reflector, resulting in a combination of additive and subtractive color mixing, light can also change in chromaticity by passing through a substance. A good example of that is sunlight passing through the atmosphere. From the moment sunlight reaches the edge of the atmosphere to the moment it reaches the surface of the earth it has lost in power over three quarters of the UV-spectrum and about 10-20% of the visible spectrum on a clear day. By then it’s a combination of direct, scattered and reflected light. The scattering is also the reason why the sky is blue, a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where light is scattered by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. \n \n \n \n \nPointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \nPointer’s gamut covers 47.9% of the chromaticities in the CIE 1931 xyY color space. The irregular shape of Pointer’s gamut immediately clarifies why it’s hard to make a display that can reproduce all colors in the Pointer’s gamut using RGB primaries. In fact, as will be shown later in this article, it’s impossible to create an RGB color space using real primaries (as opposed to imaginary primaries) that covers a true 100% of the Pointer’s gamut. For that a color model with at least 4 primaries is required. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n  \n \nPointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \nPointer’s gamut covers 46.2% of the chromaticities in the CIE 1976 L*u*v* color space. When comparing the Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram to the Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram (Figure 6 and 7), you’ll notice a large difference in the colors outside of Pointer’s gamut. In the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram these are mostly green and cyan hues, while in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram they are mostly blue and violet hues. This is due to the fact that the linear density along the spectral locus in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram differs quite a lot from that in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. In the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram peak sensitivity is at 497 nm (cyan) and in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram it’s at 483 nm (azure). While a difference of only 14 nm in wavelength might seem small, you can see that in both the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram and the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram this results in a pronounced difference in hue. Another reason for the difference between the Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy and the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram, is the increased sensitivity for purple hues in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \n \nRGB Color spaces \n \n \nNearly every capture - or display device nowadays uses an RGB color model to describe the color for every pixel. Looking at the CIE 1931 xy and CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagrams it’s easy to see why: when using three primaries you can cover the most by using red, green and blue primaries. This data has a little meaning though without a color space assigned to it. A pixel with 8-bit color depth per channel with RGB value [255; 0; 0] would obviously be red. But without a color space assigned there would be no way to tell what the chromaticity for red should be. If the gamut of the capture device would be identical to that of the display device and the two were directly connected, that wouldn’t be a problem. Unfortunately that’s never the case. \n \nRec. 709 / sRGB \n \n \nThe ITU-R Recommendation BT. 709, or simply Rec. 709, standardizes the format of high-definition television, first approved in 1990. It specifies many aspects of image display, but what we’re interested in here are the primary chromaticities. These are mostly identical to the ones specified by ITU-R BT. 470-6 / EBU Tech 3213 used for PAL-television, only the x-coordinate for green is different in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.640 \n	 \n \n0.330 \n	 \n \n0.451 \n	 \n \n0.523 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.300 \n	 \n \n0.600 \n	 \n \n0.125 \n	 \n \n0.563 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.150 \n	 \n \n0.060 \n	 \n \n0.175 \n	 \n \n0.158 \n \n \n \nWhen plotted in either the CIE 1931 xy or CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram it immediately becomes apparent that this is a fairly small color space. In the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram it covers only 33.5% of the chromaticities and 69.4% of Pointer’s gamut. In CIE 1976 u’v’ these values are 33.2% and 70.2% respectively. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8: Rec. 709 / sRGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Rec. 709 / sRGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \nsRGB \n \n \n \nsRGB is an RGB color space created by HP and Microsoft in 1996, for use on displays, printers and the Internet. The sRGB color space uses the same primaries and white point as Rec. 709. The biggest difference between these two is that sRGB is just an absolute color space, specifying only chromaticities of primaries and white point and a gamma correction curve. Whereas Rec. 709 specifies far more aspects of image display, including pixel count and frame rate. \n \n \nThere are also differences in the properties specified by both - Rec. 709 coding use SMPTE reference levels (also known as narrow range), where reference black has an 8-bit RGB value of [16; 16; 16] and reference white [235; 235; 235], sRGB uses the full 8-bit color depth for each channel. There’s also a difference in gamma, Rec. 709 uses a gamma of 2.4, whereas sRGB uses an average gamma of 2.2. \n \n \nAt the time of introduction most CRT monitors were able to reproduce the entire sRGB color space, having color gamuts with very similar primaries, aiding greatly with its acceptance. This continued with the introduction of TFT LCD displays. Nowadays most display panels still have a color gamut with primaries that a more or less the same as the ones sRGB uses. This has led to most software being designed with the assumption that in the absence of a color profile specifying otherwise the color gamut of the display can be assumed to be equal to the sRGB color space. This is also true for all popular operating systems, regardless of platform. The same applies for content without a color profile. \n \n \nThis would all be great (most displays and software all using the same color space), if it weren’t for the fact that sRGB is a quite small color space. On a wide gamut display all colors would be oversaturated without calibration. Once calibrated content exported in sRGB or without a color space assigned to it (and therefore assumed as sRGB) would be displayed correctly. This however does also mean that out of the entire gamut of the display only the part covered by the sRGB color space will be used. Seems a bit pointless to put any effort in display quality if you’re going to limit the color output to just over two thirds of the Pointer gamut and just a third of all colors. In the very least you would like to cover all diffuse surface colors (Pointer’s gamut). But it would make sense to cover even more, since the color gamut of objects extends outside the Pointer’s gamut with specular reflection and light passing through a substance can also easily have a chromaticity that’s outside the Pointer’s gamut. The sky for instance can have many colors in it not inside the Pointer’s gamut. \n \n \nAdobe RGB \n \n \nThe Adobe RGB (1998) color space was developed by Adobe Systems, Inc. to improve upon the gamut of the sRGB color space in primarily cyan-green hues, for better conversion to the subtractive CMYK color model used by printers. It uses the same red and blue primaries as the sRGB color space, but the green primary is more saturated and also of a much deeper hue of green (sRGB uses a rather yellowish hue of green). The green primary is the same as that of the NTSC 1953 color space. \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.640 \n	 \n \n0.330 \n	 \n \n0.451 \n	 \n \n0.523 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.210 \n	 \n \n0.710 \n	 \n \n0.076 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.150 \n	 \n \n0.060 \n	 \n \n0.175 \n	 \n \n0.158 \n \n \n \nIn the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram this results in a significant improvement over the sRGB color space, covering 45.2% of all chromaticities and 86.2% of Pointer’s gamut. In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram the difference is far less pronounced: covering 38.7% of all chromaticities and 80.3% of Pointer’s gamut. This is due to Adobe RGB using the same red and blue primaries as sRGB. This also brings us to one of the downsides of Adobe RGB: for wide gamut displays it’s still not wide enough, primarily in red and blue, and at the same time it’s not as widely supported as sRGB. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10: Adobe RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11: Adobe RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nAdobe Wide Gamut RGB \n \n \nThe Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space was, like the Adobe RGB ’98 color space, developed by Adobe System, Inc. It has a very wide gamut by using monochromatic primaries with very wide spread hues. It covers 77.6% of the CIELAB color space, whereas the Adobe RGB ’98 color space only covers 52.1% and sRGB 35.9%. \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n700 nm \n	 \n \n0.73469 \n	 \n \n0.26531 \n	 \n \n0.62337 \n	 \n \n0.50650 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n525 nm \n	 \n \n0.11416 \n	 \n \n0.82621 \n	 \n \n0.03600 \n	 \n \n0.58614 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n450 nm \n	 \n \n0.15664 \n	 \n \n0.01770 \n	 \n \n0.21612 \n	 \n \n0.05496 \n \n \n \nIn the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram the Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space covers 71.5% of all chromaticities and 99.1% of Pointer’s gamut.

With the currently technology it would be extremely hard, if not altogether impossible, to create a display that can reproduce this color gamut. Even if it were possible to produce a display with these primaries, the red one would have to be extremely bright, because our eyes are hardly sensitive to light with a wavelength of 700 nm (as can be seen in Figure 2). \n \n \nIt also uses the CIE Standard Illuminant D50 as white point. Nearly all display panels use D65 as native white point. Changing this results in the loss of usable color depth. With 8-bit color depth white would no longer be [255; 255; 255], but more something along the line of [255; 250; 240] (not actually calculated). This brings us to the next problem: a color space this size would require a high color depth to avoid posterization effects (color banding). To date setting up an end to end workflow with 10-bit color depth per channel has proven to be quite a challenge already, and that might not even cut it. For a color space this size 12-bit or even 16-bit color depth per channel might be necessary. \n \n \n \nThe reason it’s hard to set up an end to end Deep color workflow is because there are a couple of bottlenecks in the chain (in bold): \n \n \n \nCapture device > file format > application > operating system > graphics card driver > graphics card > interface/interconnect > display electronics > display panel \n \n \n    Applications: while there are many applications that support working and exporting in high color depth (mainly image / video editing or content creation software), hardly any of them support 10-bit display output. With a quick search the only two I could find were Adobe Photoshop (CS6 or newer) and Zoner Photo Studio (v13 or newer). \n     \n \n    Graphics card driver: even though nearly all modern graphics cards have hardware support for Deep Color, it’s only usable on the Nvidia Quadro (not including Quadro NVS) and AMD FirePro series of graphics cards for professional use. For some reason a lot of features aren’t available on graphics cards of the Nvidia GeForce and AMD Radeon series, even though the hardware fully supports it. Among these are 10-bit color depth support and full OpenGL support. \n     \n \n    Display panel: true 10-bit display panels are quite scarce and the displays that hold them are usually very expensive. Most displays that are specified as having 10-bit color depth are in fact regular 8-bit color depth panels with an FRC-module implemented in the display electronics. FRC stands for Frame Rate Control, a form of temporal dithering. When an 8-bit+FRC panel is told to display a 10-bit color that isn’t an 8-bit color, it will alternate between the two closest 8-bit colors with each subsequent frame, thus approximating the desired color. The downside of this is that it only works well for static content. With darker colors it can also produce some visible flicker. \n \n \n \nDCI-P3 \n \n \nThe DCI-P3 color space is a part of the SMPTE RP 431-2 standard for “Digital Cinema Quality – Reference Projector and Environment”, which was first released by the SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers) in 2007. The latest version of this standard is RP 431-2:2011. The SMPTE RP 431-2 standard defines the Reference Projector and its controlled environment, along with the acceptable tolerances around critical image parameters for Review Room and Theatre applications. The goal is to provide a means for achieving consistent and repeatable color image quality. (Source: SMPTE). \n \n \n \nThe “DCI” in the name of the DCI-P3 color space stands for Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC. This is a joint venture, founded in 2002, of seven of the largest motion picture studios: \n \n    20th Century Fox \n \n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \n \n    Paramount Pictures \n \n    Sony Pictures Entertainment \n \n    Universal Studios \n \n    The Walt Disney Company \n \n    Warner Bros. \n \nAlthough Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer withdrew as a member of DCI in May 2005, prior to the release of the DCI specification. (Source: DCI) \n \n \n \nThe DCI-P3 color space uses the same blue primary as the Rec. 470-6, Rec. 709, sRGB and Adobe RGB color spaces, but it uses different green and red primaries. The red primary of DCI-P3 is monochromatic 615 nm, a slightly deeper hue of red than the nearly monochromatic 611 nm red primary of NTSC 1953. The green primary is a slightly more yellowish hue of green than that of the Adobe RGB and NTSC 1953 green primary, but more saturated. \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.680 \n	 \n \n0.320 \n	 \n \n0.496 \n	 \n \n0.526 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.265 \n	 \n \n0.690 \n	 \n \n0.099 \n	 \n \n0.578 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.150 \n	 \n \n0.060 \n	 \n \n0.175 \n	 \n \n0.158 \n \n \n \nIn the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram the DCI-P3 color space covers 45.5% of all chromaticities and 86.9% of Pointer’s gamut.

The only display I could find that covers the entire DCI-P3 color space is the Dolby Professional Reference Monitor PRM-4200. The new Canon DP-V3010 reference display also comes very close though. This probably has to do with the fact that the DCI-P3 color space is designed for cinema projectors, not displays. \n \n \n \nNTSC 1953 \n \n \nNTSC 1953 was the analog television standard for most of the Americas and a few countries in Asia. Today it’s no longer used for that purpose, because analog television has been superseded by digital television. A few specifications of the NTSC 1953 standard are still in use today though. DVD's released in countries that used NTSC are still in 480i resolution. Nearly all video content in these countries still uses the NTSC frame rate of 60Hz. \n \n \nNTSC uses a red primary that’s a more orange hue of red than the one used by sRGB and Adobe RGB, but very saturated, it’s very close to monochromatic 611 nm light. The green primary is the same as the one used by the Adobe RGB color space (or actually it’s the other way round). The blue primary is about as saturated as the one used by the sRGB and Adobe RGB colour spaces, but with a hue closer to azure than blue. In CIE 1931 xy it covers 47.3% of all chromaticities and 89.5% of Pointer’s gamut. In CIE 1976 u’v’ these numbers are 38.1% and 79.4% respectively. \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.670 \n	 \n \n0.330 \n	 \n \n0.477 \n	 \n \n0.528 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.210 \n	 \n \n0.710 \n	 \n \n0.076 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.140 \n	 \n \n0.080 \n	 \n \n0.152 \n	 \n \n0.196 \n \n \n \nWhile the NTSC 1953 color space is no longer used for its original purposes, it is still used as a reference to describe the size of the color gamut of a display. This is simply done by comparing the size. You calculate the area of the color gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram using the chromaticity coordinates and divide the result by 0.1582 (the area of NTSC 1953 in CIE 1931 xy). The size of the gamut is therefore only relative and not equal to the coverage of the NTSC 1953 color space, unless all three primaries of the color gamut of the display lie inside or on the edges of the NTSC color space. \n \n \nThe same can be done in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram by converting the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates of both the NTSC 1953 color space and the display gamut and calculate the area using those converted coordinates. This usually results in a higher number, because most displays use a deeper hue for both the red and blue primary than the NTSC 1953 color space. In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these make up larger portion of the colors than in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16: NTSC 1953 and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17: NTSC 1953 and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \nProPhoto RGB \n \n \nProPhoto RGB is a rather unusual color space, because it uses imaginary green and blue primaries. Part of the color space is therefore imaginary as well. The red primary is the same as in the Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space: monochromatic 700 nm. \n \n \nThe most notable use of the ProPhoto RGB color space is by the Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera RAW software, however not in pure form. The Lightroom RGB space uses a gamma of 1.0, whereas ProPhoto RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. The reason for this is that Lightroom is primarily a RAW-image editor and RAW-images are not gamma encoded, but use a linear gamma of 1.0. The Lightroom RGB space does use the same primaries as ProPhoto RGB though. \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.7347 \n	 \n \n0.2653 \n	 \n \n0.6234 \n	 \n \n0.5065 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.1596 \n	 \n \n0.8404 \n	 \n \n0.0500 \n	 \n \n0.5925 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.0366 \n	 \n \n0.0001 \n	 \n \n0.0500 \n	 \n \n0.0003 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18: ProPhoto RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19: ProPhoto RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nMost, if not all sources, will claim that 13% of the colors in the ProPhoto RGB color space are imaginary.

In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram 11.87% of the chromaticities in ProPhoto RGB fall outside the CIE L*u*v* color space.

It is the standard for Ultra High Definition Television (UHD-TV), which knows two versions: 4K (3840x2160 and 4096x2160) and 8K (7680x4320 and 8192x4320). Apart from the obvious improvement in resolution over the Rec. 709 standard, the Rec. 2020 standard also improves upon its predecessor in many other ways. The maximum frame rate doubles from 60 Hz progressive to 120 Hz progressive (interlaced resolutions are no longer supported, which is good). The color depth also increases by at least 2 bits per channel, with the possibility of 4 bits. Because Rec. 709 and Rec. 2020 both use studio swing /narrow band, this does not result in the usual 16.8 million, 1.07 billion and 68.7 billion colors though. \n \n \nBit depth per channel \n	 \n \nReference black level \n	 \n \nReference white level \n	 \n \nUsable combinations per channel \n	 \n \nTotal number of colors \n \n8 \n	 \n \n16 \n	 \n \n235 \n	 \n \n220 \n	 \n \n10,648,000 \n \n10 \n	 \n \n64 \n	 \n \n940 \n	 \n \n877 \n	 \n \n674,526,133 \n \n12 \n	 \n \n256 \n	 \n \n3760 \n	 \n \n3505 \n	 \n \n43,059,012,625 \n \n \n \nLast but not least, the Rec. 2020 offers significant improvement over the Rec. 709 standard when it comes to the color gamut: nearly twice the size of its predecessor. It uses three monochromatic primaries with wavelengths of 630, 532 and 467 nm. This results in a very large gamut, but without most of the drawbacks of even larger color spaces like the Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space. \n \n \n \nMost of the thought process behind the origin of these primaries can be found in ITU Recommendation BT 2246-2:2012. The summarized version is that UHD-TV should have a larger color gamut in order to cover the real surface colors (based on Pointer’s gamut and SOCS database) as much as possible using real primaries. \n \n \n \nTwo sets of primaries were proposed. Korea proposed 625, 531 and 467 nm, because 625 and 531 nm are on the equi-hue lines of the red and green primaries respectively of LED-backlit LCD and AMOLED. Japan proposed 635, 532 and 467 nm, because 635 and 532 are easily realized with current laser technology. \n \n \n \nFor red the equi-hue lines for CIELAB ΔE= ±2 for 625, 635 and their average, 630 nm, were plotted in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. The equi-hue area for 630 nm with CIELAB ΔE= ±2 largely overlapped with those for 625 and 635 nm. So 630 nm was chosen as red primary, because it could reflect the characteristics of both displays types (flat panel and laser displays). \n \n \n \nThe performance of both modified sets, using the same 630 and 467 nm red and blue primaries, but different green primaries of 531 and 532 nm, was then tested by calculating the coverage of the Pointer’s gamut and the DCI-P3, Rec. 709, NTSC 1953 and Adobe RGB color spaces. While there was no significant difference between the two, the 532 nm primary proposed by Japan was chosen as the green primary for Rec. 2020. \n \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n630 \n	 \n \n0.70792 \n	 \n \n0.29203 \n	 \n \n0.55649 \n	 \n \n0.51651 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n532 \n	 \n \n0.17024 \n	 \n \n0.79652 \n	 \n \n0.05573 \n	 \n \n0.58674 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n467 \n	 \n \n0.13137 \n	 \n \n0.04588 \n	 \n \n0.15983 \n	 \n \n0.12558 \n \n \n \nThe resulting colors space covers 63.3% of all chromaticities and 99.9% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 57.2% and 99.7%. \n \n \nWhat makes this color space particularly interesting is that it covers the entire sRGB and Adobe RGB color space in both chromaticity diagrams and only just shy of covering the entire DCI-P3 and NTSC 1953 color spaces with a negligible portion of up to 0.02% falling outside its gamut. This makes it possible to display nearly all content available with accurate colors. With the Rec. 2020 standard improving on nearly every other standard for content display in most, if not all, aspects of image quality, I strongly encourage both the television industry and all display manufacturers to embrace this standard, because it could take content display to a whole new level. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 20: Rec. 2020 and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21: Rec. 2020 and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \nOptimal RGB color space for Pointer’s gamut coverage \n \n \nThe RGB color space specified by the Rec. 2020 standard is actually extremely close to the optimal RGB color space (using real primaries) for coverage of the Pointer’s gamut. The red and blue primaries are already spot on and the green primary differs only 5 nm from optimal. The optimal RGB color space would have the following primaries: \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n630 \n	 \n \n0.70792 \n	 \n \n0.29203 \n	 \n \n0.55649 \n	 \n \n0.51651 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n527 \n	 \n \n0.13055 \n	 \n \n0.81893 \n	 \n \n0.04156 \n	 \n \n0.58563 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n467 \n	 \n \n0.13137 \n	 \n \n0.04588 \n	 \n \n0.15983 \n	 \n \n0.12558 \n \n \n \nThe resulting color space covers 66.7% of all the chromaticities in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram and 58.6% of the chromaticities in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. The coverage of the Pointer’s gamut is not a true 100% as can be seen in Figure a and Figure b, but the difference is too small to give an accurate value of the coverage. \n \n \n \nIn the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram the Matlab program gives a coverage of 99.9584%, but it should be noted that the coverage of the Pointer’s gamut by the Pointer’s gamut is 99.9774% according to the same program. Obviously this should be a 100%. A more accurate representation of the actual value would be dividing the first value by the second value, which yields 99.9810%. Either way the difference is negligible, therefore the coverage can be assumed to be a 100%. \n \n \n \nThe same applies in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram, where the calculated coverage by the optimal color space divided by the calculated coverage by Pointer’s gamut itself yields a value of 99.9614%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure a: Optimal color space for Pointer’s coverage (red), Rec. 2020 (blue) and Pointer’s gamut (black) in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \nFigure b: Optimal color space for Pointer’s coverage (red), Rec. 2020 (blue) and Pointer’s gamut (black) in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \nAs can be seen in Figure a and b, the optimal RGB color space for Pointer’s gamut coverage has minor decrease in saturation in yellow and orange compared to the Rec. 2020 color space. On the other hand you do get a deeper hue of green and better saturation in cyan and blue. You also get a better coverage of the ProPhoto RGB color space, but the coverage of the DCI-P3 and NTSC 1953 color spaces are slightly lower. Coverage of the Adobe RGB and sRGB/Rec. 709 color spaces are still a true 100%. \n \nThe reason that 527 nm wasn’t even considered, Korea proposed 531 nm and Japan 532 nm, was that the proposed primaries were based on what’s currently possible with LED backlit LCD and AMOLED and with Laser displays respectively. It would not make sense to use a green primary that can’t be easily reproduces by any of the display technologies and also has a lower coverage of the DCI-P3 and NTSC 1953 color spaces to just have a slightly higher coverage of the Pointer’s gamut. \n \nMaximum achievable color gamut using RGB primaries \n \n \nUnlike the previous color spaces discussed, this is not an actual color space. It is just a gamut I’ve calculated that achieves the highest coverage of the chromaticity diagrams. Because of the difference in shape and linear density along the spectral locus, this gamut doesn’t use the same primaries in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram as the ones it uses in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. It should be noted that a display with this gamut would have the same problems as discussed earlier for the Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space. The even larger gamut would even aggravate these problems. \n \n \nIn the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram the maximum achievable gamut covers 73.8% of all chromaticities and 97.7% of Pointer’s gamut, using three monochromatic primaries with wavelengths of 700, 518 and 433 nm (RGB). In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram the maximum achievable color gamut covers is 83.4% of all chromaticities and 96.8% of Pointer’s gamut, using the same 700 nm primary for red, but different ones for green and blue, with wavelength of 514 and 412 nm respectively. This also means that the maximum achievable RGB color gamut in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram is larger than the ProPhoto RGB color space, which only covers 76.5% of the colors. Even though it uses only real primaries, while two of ProPhoto RGB’s primaries are imaginary. \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n700 nm \n	 \n \n0.73469 \n	 \n \n0.26531 \n	 \n \n700 nm \n	 \n \n0.62337 \n	 \n \n0.50650 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n518 nm \n	 \n \n0.05933 \n	 \n \n0.82943 \n	 \n \n514 nm \n	 \n \n0.01044 \n	 \n \n0.57491 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n433 nm \n	 \n \n0.16775 \n	 \n \n0.00782 \n	 \n \n412 nm \n	 \n \n0.25420 \n	 \n \n0.01591 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22: maximum achievable 3 primary gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 23: maximum achievable 3 primary gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \n \nMaximum achievable color gamut using more than 3 primaries \n \n \nUsing more than three primaries makes it possible to cover nearly all visible colors.

The coverage of the chromaticities in the CIE 1976 L*u*v* color space is also higher than that of the CIE 1931 xyY color space for the same number of primaries. This is because the curve around green is smaller, making it easier to approximate it with a polygon with a low number of vertices. \n \n \nThe result of this is that you can already cover nearly as much of the CIE 1976 L*u*v* color space with 3 primaries, as you can cover of the CIE 1931 xyY color space with 4 primaries. With 4 you can already cover more of CIE 1976 L*u*v* than with 5 of CIE 1931 xyY, and the same applies for 5 in CIE 1976 versus 6 in CIE 1931. The curve around green also means that for color models with 5 or more primaries, you’ll end up with more than one green primary for coverage optimization of the CIE 1931 xyY color space. With 6 primaries you’ll also have two green primaries in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram. As discussed earlier in the paragraph about the line of purples, adding a magenta primary would be redundant. Adding a yellow (580 nm) primary would be too, because in both the CIE 1931 xy and CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagrams the spectral locus is a straight line (with an accuracy of 4 significant figures) between 780 and 560 nm. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 24: maximum achievable 6 primary gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \nFigure 25: maximum achievable 6 primary gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \nACES RGB \n \n \nACES RGB is part of the ACES standard (Academy Color Encoding System) developed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (probably best known for the Academy Awards) with major contributions from other companies, including: \n \n    Adobe \n \n    Arri \n \n    Autodesk \n \n    Dolby \n \n    Fujifilm \n \n    Kodak \n \n    Pixar \n \n    Sony \n \nDevelopment started in 2004 and was finished in 2013 (although it will probably receive at least a few more updates). The ACES is standardized by the SMPTE standards ST 2065-1:2012, ST 2065-2:2012, 2065-3:2012 and ST 2065-4:2013. \n \n \n \nThe ACES standard was introduced to form a single standard again. In the analog age 35 mm film was the standard, but with the digitization nearly every camera manufacturer has a different RAW-output format and there’s no single standard for CGI/VFX either. \n \n \n \nThe goal of the standard is to create a complete architecture for production, mastering and archiving (also for the source master) that supports every possible input and output format (not only currently available but including whatever might be possible in the future) without the loss of data. To achieve this, ACES standardizes the file format, color management system and image-interchange framework. \n \n \nFloating-point encoding \n \n \nThe idea of the ACES is that it stores data scene-referred, rather than output-referred. So instead of storing white as [255; 255; 255] (for an 8-bit example) and let it depend on the display or projector what white is, you store the relative scene luminance (exposure). This also means that there is also no gamma encoding, because the real world it’s linear: if the energy of the light source is twice as high the exposure will be twice as high and therefore the stored value will also be twice as high. \n \n \n \nThe reason for gamma encoding is that human contrast perception if proportional to luminance; you can discriminate smaller differences in luminance at lower luminance levels. It would for instance be difficult to perceive any difference between 200 and 201 cd/m², while the difference between 1 and 2 cd/m² would be easily perceived by anyone. The absolute difference is the same, but the relative difference is 200 times greater. \n \n \n \nWithout gamma encoding you’d lose accuracy in the dark end of the spectrum when using fixed-point (integer) encoding. To solve this, ACES uses floating-point (scientific notation) encoding by using part of the bit depth for the fraction and part for the exponent. The result of this is that the number of levels between two stops (stop is increase in exposure by a factor of two) is equal over the entire dynamic range. With integer encoding (for linear gamma) this varies dramatically, for instance there are 0 levels in between 1 and 2, while there are 63 levels in between 64 and 128. Both are a 1 stop difference. \n \n \n \nThe floating-point encoding used by ACES also results in a massive dynamic range of over 30 stops (over a billion to one contrast ratio).

The practical sequential contrast ratio (for which our eyes can adapt in the order of tenths of a second) is in the order of 1,000-10,000:1 (10-13.3 stops). \n \n \n \nIt also has to be noted that while video and photo cameras currently capable of dynamic ranges of just over 16.5 stops at best, higher dynamic ranges can be achieved by using HDR capture methods. The RED Mysterium-X and Scarlet-X are capable of dynamic ranges up to 18 stops (~260,000:1) using HDRx, while the native sensor dynamic range is only 13.5 stops (11,500:1). Some specialized measurement devices have far greater native dynamic ranges, the Klein K10-A colorimeter for instance is capable of measuring brightness from 10,000 cd/m² all the way down to 0.00006 cd/m², resulting in a dynamic range of 27.3 stops (about 165,000,000:1 contrast ratio). \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of the 16-bit floating-point encoding used by ACES is that it does not introduce color quantization errors (color banding). Although there can still be color banding in the output, because of the display device itself. \n \n \nColorimetry \n \n \nNot only the encoding used by ACES, but also the colorimetry is designed to encompass all data possible for both current and future capture and display devices (for the visible spectrum that is). \n \n \n \nTo do this, it uses three imaginary primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.73470 \n	 \n \n0.26530 \n	 \n \n0.62339 \n	 \n \n0.50649 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.00000 \n	 \n \n1.00000 \n	 \n \n0.00000 \n	 \n \n0.60000 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.00010 \n	 \n \n-0.07700 \n	 \n \n0.00019 \n	 \n \n-0.33385 \n \n \n \nYou might have noticed that the red primary appears to be the same red primary used by ProPhoto RGB color space. This however is not the case. The value might be the same, but the number of significant figures isn’t. The red primary of ProPhoto RGB uses four significant figures, which makes it the same as all points on the spectral locus for every wavelength up from 698 nm. It can therefore be assumed to be a monochromatic real primary with any wavelength up from 698 nm (up from 780 nm the brightness would have to be near infinite though, because the sensitivity approximates zero). \n \n \n \nThe ACES RGB primary however is specified in five significant figures and is therefore no longer on the spectral locus, because no wavelength on the spectral locus has an x-coordinate ≥ 0.734695 and y-coordinate < 0.265305. \n \n \n \nThese primaries were chosen so that the resulting color space would encompass the entire visible spectrum. It therefore completely covers every real color space and also some with imaginary primaries (like ProPhoto RGB). \n \n \n \n \nFigure e: ACES RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n \nFigure f: ACES RGB and Pointer’s gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe downside of these primaries is that in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram 15.5% of ACES RGB is imaginary and in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram this is even 32.8%. Except for some coding inefficiency this is not a real problem though, because with the 16-bit floating-point encoding it doesn’t really matter that you lose a part to imaginary colors, because even then it’s still far more accurate than any capture or display device or our eyes. \n \n \nInput Device Transform (IDT) and Output Device Transform (ODT) \n \n \nThe downside of ACES is that it requires device specific transformations to and from ACES and it’s even recommended to have different IDT’s and ODT’s for different environments. For cameras you’d have an IDT for sunlight and one for incandescent-tungsten studio lighting. With displays you would ideally have different ODT’s for normal light conditions and a darkened room. These IDT’s and ODT’s have to be supplied by the manufacturers. If there isn’t an IDT / ODT for your capture / display device there’s no point in using ACES. \n \n \n \n \nFigure g: ACES Idealized system block diagram \n \n \n \n \n \nMonitor Panels \n \n \nTo give an idea of where we stand today when it comes to the coverage of the Pointer’s gamut a few high-end wide gamut display panels will be discussed. An average desktop panel has deliberately not been included, because the average desktop panel will have a gamut that’s roughly equal to the sRGB color space. Even though the primaries are almost never identical to those of the sRGB color space, if one were to take the average primaries of a large number of panels from different panel manufacturers the resulting primaries would come very close to the primaries of the sRGB color space. \nAU Optronics M270DAN01.1 \n \n \nThe AU Optronics M270DAN01.1 is a relatively new panel, using AU Optronics’ Advanced Hyper-Viewing Angle (AHVA) panel technology, which is quite similar to IPS. Like most current high-end 27” panels it has a 2560x1440 pixel resolution. What makes this panel interesting though are the true 10-bit color depth per channel and the massive color gamut. The M270DAN01.1 uses the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.689 \n	 \n \n0.299 \n	 \n \n0.529 \n	 \n \n0.517 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.208 \n	 \n \n0.714 \n	 \n \n0.075 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.149 \n	 \n \n0.050 \n	 \n \n0.180 \n	 \n \n0.136 \n \n \n \nThis results in a gamut that covers about half of all chromaticities, in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram it’s 51.4% and in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram it’s 49.5%. The coverage of the Pointer’s gamut for both chromaticity diagrams are 94.2% and 94.5% respectively. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 26: AU Optronics M270DAN01.1 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 27: AU Optronics M270DAN01.1 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \nLG Display LM240WU4 \n \n \nThe LG Display LM240WU4 panel is a high-end wide gamut CCFL backlit H-IPS panel that was featured in many high-end displays from late 2008 to mid 2011, of which some are still sold today. Among these were some very high-end reference displays for color critical work: \n \n    Eizo ColorEdge CG243W \n \n    Eizo ColorEdge CG245W \n \n    NEC SpectraView Reference 241 \n \n    Quato Intelli Proof 240 Motion \n \n    Quato Intelli Proof 242 excellence \n \n    Quato Intelli Proof 244 excellence \n \nAnother display that used the LM240WU4 panel was the very popular Dell UltraSharp U2410. The LM240WU4 panel has a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels and an 8-bit color depth for the SLA1 and SLA3 versions, 8-bit+FRC for the SLB1 and SLB3 versions. All versions use the same primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.680 \n	 \n \n0.310 \n	 \n \n0.507 \n	 \n \n0.521 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.206 \n	 \n \n0.693 \n	 \n \n0.076 \n	 \n \n0.572 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.151 \n	 \n \n0.055 \n	 \n \n0.180 \n	 \n \n0.147 \n \n \n \nThe resulting gamut covers 48.4% of all chromaticities and 92.3% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 45.5% and 91.8%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 28: LG Display LM240WU4 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 29: LG Display LM240WU4 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \n \nLG Display LM240WU5-SLA1 \n \n \nEven though this panel is already nearly six years old, it is still one of the most high-end panels to date. Only three display models use the LM240WU5-SLA1 panel: \n \n    HP DreamColor LP2480zx \n \n    LG W2420R \n \n    Quato Intelli Proof 240 excellence LED \n \nThe HP is still in production. While the LG and Quato are still sold by some resellers, it’s only remaining stock. Production of the LG was ceased sometime last year and Quatographic Technology GmbH has been decommissioned completely since August 15th last year. \n \nHP DreamColor LP2480zx \n \n \nThe HP DreamColor LP2480zx was the first released out of those three, first announced in April 2008 and released on June 12th 2008. It was the result of a collaboration between HP and DreamWorks Animation SKG, made to fill the gap between studio grade reference monitors, with prices in excess of £10,000, and the average high-end computer display at the time. According to DreamWorks an important factor that led to this initiative was the disappearance of CRT-monitors (which still outperform the average LCD display in many aspects of image display): \n \n \n″Color is absolutely critical to what we do here at DreamWorks. Prior to the DreamColor display our entire color infrastructure was based on CRT monitors. The problem was: CRT stopped being made. We were left without a solution for our film makers. Nobody was choosing to solve that problem. It is at that point we realized: not only did we need a solution, the entire imaging industry needed a good solution for color accurate displays.″ \n \n \nThe LP2480zx was the first computer display to have a true 10-bit color depth per channel and it also had an extremely wide color gamut compared to other high-end displays at the time. Even today the true 10-bit color depth and the size of the color gamut are exceptional. \n \n \nIt comes with its own color management system: HP DreamColor Advanced Profiling Solution, now simply called HP DreamColor, developed by X-Rite. The latest version is nearly identical to the Dell UltraSharp Color Calibration Solution (discussed in the reviews of the U2413, U2713H, U3014 and UP3214Q), both are based on the X-Rite i1Profiler 1.4.2 software. It offers hardware calibration of the display and color gamut remapping through its 12-bit LUT and also allows you to change the white point of the display at backlight level (D50, D55, D65 and custom), instead of in the panel, thus losing none of the available color depth. The color gamut can be remapped to any of the color spaces listed below, as well as custom color spaces. \n \n    Rec. 601 \n \n    Rec. 709 \n \n    DCI-P3 Emulation (native gamut doesn’t completely cover DCI-P3) \n \n    sRGB \n \n    Adobe RGB \n \nWhat also made this display stand out was the ability to sync to frame rates all the way down to 47.952 Hz, making it possible to display nearly all common video frame rates (some at exactly double the actual frame rate). \n \n \nLG W2420R \n \n \nThe LG W2420R was released in May 2009. Unlike the LP2480zx, the W2420R did not acquire a reference status among people in the imaging industry. This probably had to do with the bundling of the DataColor Spyder 3 colorimeter, which was not at all suitable for calibrating an RGB-LED backlit display. The True Color Finder software that came along with it also did not offer the same feature set as the HP equivalent. The new True Color Pro calibration solution from LG still fails to achieve accurate results, but at least it now uses a colorimeter that’s suitable for wide gamut displays: an LG branded colorimeter based on the MAZeT True Color sensor (MTCSiCT). \n \nQuato Intelli Proof 240 excellence LED \n \n \nThe Quato Intelli Proof 240 excellence LED was released around the same time as the LG. While the HP is more focused towards video editing, the Quato is primarily focused on soft proofing, although it’s still perfectly suitable as a video editing display. This is perhaps best shown by the Fogra Soft Proofing certification and the Ugra certification, as well as the support for ECI-RGB (RGB working color space designed to include all printable colors, regardless of the printing technology used) and ISO Coated v2 (color space for offset printing). \n \n \nThe IP240ex LED has a 7x5 zones active uniformity compensation that equalizes brightness and color across the display. Like the HP and LG it also comes with a color management system, iColor Display, capable of hardware calibration and gamut remapping. Another interesting feature is the implementation of the Faroudja DCDi technology for deinterlacing and frame rate conversion, which shows that the IP240ex LED is indeed also intended as a video editing display. \n \nPanel properties \n \n \nThe LM240WU5-SLA1 panel uses direct matrix RGB LED backlighting and has true 10-bit color depth. It has a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels. The LM240WU5-SLA1 uses the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.690 \n	 \n \n0.300 \n	 \n \n0.529 \n	 \n \n0.517 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.205 \n	 \n \n0.715 \n	 \n \n0.073 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.150 \n	 \n \n0.045 \n	 \n \n0.185 \n	 \n \n0.125 \n \n \n \nThe resulting gamut covers 52.0% of all chromaticities and 94.5% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 50.9% and 94.8%. \n \n \n \nFigure 30: LG Display LM240WU5-SLA1 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 31: LG Display LM240WU5-SLA1 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \nLG Display LM240WU9-SLA1 / LM270WQ3-SLA1 / LM300WQ6-SLA1 \n \n \nThe LG Display LM240WU9-SLA1, LM270WQ3-SLA1 and LM300WQ6-SLA1 are part of the latest generation of AH-IPS panels from LG.Display that use the GB-r-LED backlighting technology. GB-r-LED uses green and blue LEDs coated in red phosphor to create white light, whereas standard W-LED backlighting uses only blue LEDs coated in yellow phosphor. This results in a far larger color gamut that even exceeds wide gamut CCFL and approximates the color gamut of RGB-LED backlighting. \n \n \nBecause all three panels use the exact same primaries, I’ve combined them in one paragraph. Some panel properties are not the same for all three panels. Among these are obviously size and resolution, but also color depth: the LM240WU9 and LM270WQ3 have 8-bit+FRC color depth, whereas the LM300WQ6 has true 10-bit color depth. Some of the displays these panels are used in are listed below. \n \n \nLM240WU9 \n \n    Asus PA249Q \n \n    BenQ PG2401PT \n \n    Dell UltraSharp U2413 \n \n    NEC PA242W \n \nLM270WQ3 \n \n    Asus PA279Q \n \n    Dell UltraSharp U2713H \n \n    LG 27EA83 \n \n    NEC PA272W \n \nLM300WQ6 \n \n    Dell UltraSharp U3014 \n \n    Hazro HZ30WiG \n \n    Lenovo ThinkVision LT3053p \n \n    NEC PA302W \n \nThese panels use the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.680 \n	 \n \n0.310 \n	 \n \n0.507 \n	 \n \n0.521 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.210 \n	 \n \n0.700 \n	 \n \n0.077 \n	 \n \n0.574 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.147 \n	 \n \n0.054 \n	 \n \n0.175 \n	 \n \n0.145 \n \n \n \nThe resulting gamut covers 49.1% of all chromaticities and 93.1% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 45.9% and 92.3%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 32: LG Display LM240WU9 / LM270WQ3 / LM300WQ6 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 33: LG Display LM240WU9 / LM270WQ3 / LM300WQ6 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \nLG Display LM270WQ2-SLA1 \n \n \nLike the LM240WU4, which is of the same generation, the LM270WQ2 panel was featured in many displays, including high-end displays from Eizo, NEC and Quato. Probably the most popular display that used this panel was the Dell UltraSharp U2711. The LM270WQ2-SLA1 panel has a resolution of 2560x1440 pixels and an 8-bit+FRC color depth. It uses the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.678 \n	 \n \n0.309 \n	 \n \n0.507 \n	 \n \n0.520 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.202 \n	 \n \n0.689 \n	 \n \n0.074 \n	 \n \n0.571 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.148 \n	 \n \n0.051 \n	 \n \n0.179 \n	 \n \n0.138 \n \n \n \nThe resulting gamut covers 48.5% of all chromaticities and 92.5% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 46.4% and 92.8%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 34: LG Display LM270WQ2-SLA1 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 35: LG Display LM270WQ2-SLA1 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \nLG Display LM300WQ5 \n \n \nThis panel had been around for quite some time before it was finally replaced by the LM300WQ6. At least seven versions of this panel were made. The oldest version (STA2) is from November 2007, the newest version (SLA2) is from October 2010. It was featured in a large number of displays from a variety of display manufacturers that include Dell, Eizo, Hazro, HP, LG and NEC amongst others. Nearly half of all 30” display models use a version of the LM300WQ5 panel. Dell, Hazro and NEC even had multiple displays of different generations that used different versions of the LM300WQ5 panel. \n \n \nAll versions uses the same direct light 18x wide gamut CCFL-tubes backlighting and also the same color filters for the sub-pixels. Therefore the primaries are the same for all versions. The color depth is not the same for all versions though. The four STA versions have 8-bit color depth, while the SDA1, SLA1 and SLA2 have true 10-bit color depth. The primaries of the LM300WQ5 panel are: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.678 \n	 \n \n0.309 \n	 \n \n0.507 \n	 \n \n0.520 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.210 \n	 \n \n0.692 \n	 \n \n0.077 \n	 \n \n0.572 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.146 \n	 \n \n0.055 \n	 \n \n0.173 \n	 \n \n0.147 \n \n \n \nThe resulting gamut covers 48.2% of all chromaticities and 92.3% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 45.4% and 91.7%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 36: LG Display LM300WQ5 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 37: LG Display LM300WQ5 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \n \nSamsung LTM240CS02 \n \n \nUnlike all the LG.Display panels discussed before, which were IPS panels, and the AU Optronics M270DAN01.1, which uses a technology similar to IPS, the Samsung LTM240CS02 panel is based on a Vertical Alignment technology, Super Patterned Vertical Alignment (S-PVA) to be precise. Like some versions of the LG.Display LM300WQ5 panel it’s already quite old, seven years this May. What makes it interesting though is that it was one of the first panels to use RGB-LED backlighting. This resulted in a color gamut that was extremely large at the time and unprecedented. The color depth was only a standard 8-bit per channel though. \n \n \nThe LTM240CS02 was only used in the Samsung XL24 and LaCie 724. Its bigger brother, the LTM300DS, was also only used in displays from Samsung and LaCie: XL30 and 730 respectively. It used the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.692 \n	 \n \n0.295 \n	 \n \n0.537 \n	 \n \n0.515 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.205 \n	 \n \n0.717 \n	 \n \n0.073 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.148 \n	 \n \n0.065 \n	 \n \n0.170 \n	 \n \n0.168 \n \n \n \nAs you can the green and red primaries are of an even deeper hue than those of the LG.Display LM240WU5-SLA1 panel (with roughly equal saturation), although the difference in green is negligible. The LM240WU5-SLA1 uses a blue primary though that has both a deeper hue and is more saturated than that of the LTM240CS02, which especially in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram results in a pronounced difference. Therefore the LM240WU5-SLA1 still has the larger gamut. \n \n \nThe color gamut of the LTM240CS02 panel covers 51.1% of all chromaticities and 94.0% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 46.9% and 92.8%. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 38: Samsung LTM240CS02 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 39: Samsung LTM240CS02 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \nMitsubishi LaserVue \n \n \n \nOne example of the laser displays discussed earlier in the part on the Rec. 2020 color space is the Mitsubishi LaserVue line of TV’s. These are rear projected DLP televisions using a pair of scanning mirrors (one for the horizontal direction and one for vertical) to create the image pixel by pixel. This makes the image formation process very similar to that of the electron gun in CRT monitors. \n \n \n \nThe LaserVue line was discontinued in 2012, but it seems that it has revived, because Mitsubishi showed a 4K LaserVue UHD-TV prototype last October at the CREATEC show in Japan. \n \n \n \nSome of the LaserVue models only use a laser for red and regular LED’s for blue and green, like the 4K model, but some use lasers for all primaries. The ones that use lasers for all primaries use laser diodes with wavelengths of 640, 532 and 447 nm. This results in the following primaries: \n \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nWavelength \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n640 \n	 \n \n0.71903 \n	 \n \n0.28093 \n	 \n \n0.58302 \n	 \n \n0.51254 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n532 \n	 \n \n0.17024 \n	 \n \n0.79652 \n	 \n \n0.05573 \n	 \n \n0.58674 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n447 \n	 \n \n0.15947 \n	 \n \n0.01523 \n	 \n \n0.22273 \n	 \n \n0.04787 \n \n \n \nThe resulting covers about two thirds of the chromaticity diagrams, with a coverage of 65.0% of the chromaticities in CIE 1931 xy and 69.5% of the chromaticities in CIE 1976 u’v’. The coverage of the Pointer’s gamut is 97.3% and 96.0% respectively. \n \n \n \n \nFigure c: Mitsubishi LaserVue gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \nFigure d: Mitsubishi LaserVue gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \n \nLaptop Panels \n \n \nAs with the desktop display panels a few high-end wide gamut panels for laptops will be discussed to give an indication of what’s possible in terms of gamut size and Pointer’s gamut coverage. For comparison a 45% NTSC and a 60% NTSC laptop panel have also been included. These are the most common gamut sizes on laptops. \nAU Optronics B156HW01 V0/V1/V2/V3/V5/V6 \n \n \nThe AU Optronics B156HW01 is a panel that is used in many laptops from a variety of manufacturers that include Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and MSI. Versions 4 and 7 use B+RG LED backlighting, which improves upon standard W-LED backlighting by not just using a yellow phosphor to coat the blue LEDs, but instead a red and a green phosphor, resulting in a white with better spectral distribution, which in turn results in a larger color gamut. The other six versions use standard W-LED backlighting, resulting in a color gamut of about 60% NTSC. This is the typical color gamut for displays in mainstream and high-end laptops. \n \n \nAll versions of the B156HW01 panel are based on the Twisted Nematic (TN Film) display technology, have a 1920x1080 pixels resolution and a color depth of 6-bits per channel. All versions, except for V4 and V7, use the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.623 \n	 \n \n0.351 \n	 \n \n0.418 \n	 \n \n0.530 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.336 \n	 \n \n0.574 \n	 \n \n0.146 \n	 \n \n0.561 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.148 \n	 \n \n0.053 \n	 \n \n0.177 \n	 \n \n0.143 \n \n \n \nThe resulting color gamut covers only 28.6% of all chromaticities and 59.3% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram, in the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 28.8% and 60.3%. What stands out here though is that the blue primary is similar to the ones found in high-end desktop displays. Only the red and green primaries are very different. The green primary actually is just as much yellow as it is green. The red primary is more orange than red and is actually closer to the yellow side of orange than the red side. \n \n \nWhen you look at the gamut plotted in the CIE 1931 xy or CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram you’ll notice that the only colors that these laptop panels can display fairly accurate are shades of blue and yellow/orange. This should come as no surprise, as the backlight is made up of blue LEDs coated in yellow phosphor. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 40: AU Optronics B156HW01 W-LED gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \nFigure 41: AU Optronics B156HW01 W-LED gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \nAU Optronics B156XW04 V5 \n \n \nWhile the 60% NTSC gamut for displays found in most mainstream and high-end laptops is already very small compared to the gamuts of all the desktop panels discussed earlier, it gets even worse for low-end laptops. These laptops typically have a display with a gamut that’s only 45% NTSC and also a very low resolution of just 1366x768 pixels. The B156XW04 V5 panel uses the following primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.590 \n	 \n \n0.340 \n	 \n \n0.400 \n	 \n \n0.519 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.330 \n	 \n \n0.550 \n	 \n \n0.148 \n	 \n \n0.554 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.150 \n	 \n \n0.140 \n	 \n \n0.137 \n	 \n \n0.288 \n \n \n \nThe resulting color gamut covers only 21.6% of all chromaticities and 45.1% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram it gets even worse: covering only 17.3% of the chromaticities (roughly a 1 in 5.8 ratio) and 37.4% of Pointer’s gamut. \n \n \nI personally wouldn’t use displays like these for anything other than black text on a white background, because pretty much every color would not be shown as intended. This is best shown by looking at the gamut plotted in either one of the chromaticity diagrams. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 42: AU Optronics B156XW04 V5 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 43: AU Optronics B156XW04 V5 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \nLG Display LP156WF3 / LP171WU8-SLB1 \n \n \nLuckily it isn’t all bad when it comes to laptop displays. More and more laptop manufacturers start using IPS panels in their laptops again (something that stopped sometime during 2007/2008 and started again late 2012). Unfortunately these often still have a 60% NTSC color gamut and 6-bit color depth (as with all versions of the LG Display LP156WF4 panel for instance). There are however a few exceptions, the LP156WF3 and LP171WU8-SLB1 panels definitely are among those exceptions. \n \n \nThe LM156WF3-SLB1 is the DreamColor 2 panel in the HP EliteBook 8540w and 8560w mobile workstations. The SLB2 version is the PremierColor panel in the Dell Precision M4600 mobile workstation. The SLB3 is an alternative version of the DreamColor 2 panel in the 8560w. The LP171WU8-SLB1 panel is the DreamColor 2 panel in the HP EliteBook 8740w mobile workstation. It is possible that the HP EliteBook 8570w and 8770w and Dell Precision M4700 use the same DreamColor/PremierColor-panels as the 8560w, 8760w and M4600 respectively, but this has not been confirmed. \n \n \nAll these panels use RGB-LED backlighting and have true 10-bit color depth, resulting in 4096 times the color gradations of the typical 6-bit TN laptop display. They also have a much higher contrast than typical laptop panels. The LP156WF3-SLB2 (Dell PremierColor) has a contrast of 700:1, the other three all have 800:1. The typical laptop has a contrast of only 400:1 to 600:1. All four of these panels use the same primaries: \n \n \nPrimary \n	 \n \nCIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram \n	 \n \n \n	 \n \nCIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram \n \nx \n	 \n \ny \n	 \n \nu’ \n	 \n \nv’ \n \nRed \n	 \n \n0.686 \n	 \n \n0.308 \n	 \n \n0.515 \n	 \n \n0.521 \n \nGreen \n	 \n \n0.206 \n	 \n \n0.715 \n	 \n \n0.074 \n	 \n \n0.576 \n \nBlue \n	 \n \n0.145 \n	 \n \n0.045 \n	 \n \n0.178 \n	 \n \n0.125 \n \n \n \nConsidering the average laptop has a color gamut somewhere between 45% and 60% NTSC, these panels can reproduce twice the number of colors the average laptop display can reproduce, with a color gamut of 109.49% NTSC. It covers 51.8% of the chromaticities and 95.4% of Pointer’s gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. In the CIE 1976 u’v’ chromaticity diagram these are 49.5% and 95.4% respectively. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 44: LG Display LP156WF3 / LP171WU8-SLB1 gamut in CIE 1931 xy \n \n \n \n \nFigure 45: LG Display LP156WF3 / LP171WU8-SLB1 gamut in CIE 1976 u’v’ \n \n \n \n \nLG Display LP171WU5-TLB1 \n \n \nThe LP171WU5-TLB1 is the original DreamColor panel in HP EliteBook 8730w mobile workstation, released in March 2009. Unlike with the later 8540w and 8560w, there wasn’t an optional DreamColor display for the 8530w. Dell didn’t have a PremierColor display option for their Precision series mobile workstations either at the time. \n \n \nLike all other DreamColor panels this panel uses RGB-LED backlighting. It is however the only DreamColor panel that doesn’t have true 10-bit color depth: the LP171WU5-TLB1 has to do with 8-bit color depth. \n \n \nWhat’s interesting though is that of all panels discussed in this article, including the desktop panels, it has the largest color gamut in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram. It also has the highest coverage of Pointer’s gamut, NTSC 1953, ProPhoto RGB and Rec. 2020 in the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram.

both color spaces and display panels by using monochromatic primaries, the future lies with 4, 5 and 6 primary color models. This enables us to reproduce a significantly larger palette. Sharp already has a few HD-TVs that use an RYGB color model (the Quattron models) for a couple of years now and demonstrated a prototype with RYGCB primaries that covered over 99% of the Pointer’s gamut during SID Display Week 2009 (Source: Sharp). \n \n \n \nI would say that in my opinion Rec. 2020 is currently the best color space. It covers the largest amount of Pointer’s gamut of all common RGB color spaces using real primaries and it also fully covers many other common color spaces. The 12-bit color depth specified by the standard might even be more interesting. \n \n \n \nNow it’s up to the display manufacturers to show what they can achieve. Mitsubishi has already shown the potential of laser backlit displays with their LaserVue TV’s. Furthermore, OLED seems to have finally arrived, although the first consumer OLED computer monitor is yet to be released. Something that could be really great is combining those two and make a LED display with laser diodes instead of regular (AM)-OLED. I’m not sure if that’s possible though. Another interesting technology that can boost color gamut size is the quantum dot technology (be sure to check Jeff's blog for a few interesting articles on this).",

                    Content = "\n \nQuantum dots (QD) are semiconductor devices that tightly confine electrons or holes in all three spatial dimensions. They can be made via several possible routes including colloidal synthesis, plasma synthesis, or mechanical fabrication. The term “quantum dot” was coined by Mark Reed in 1988;[1] however, they were first discovered in a glass matrix[2] by Alexey Ekimov[3][4][5] in 1981 and in colloidal solutions by Louis E. Brus in 1985.[6] The electronic properties of the quantum dots fall between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules of comparable size, and optoelectronic properties such as band gap, can be tuned as a function of particle size and shape for a given composition. For example, the photoluminescence of a QD can be manipulated to specific wavelengths by controlling particle diameter.[7][8][9] Larger QDs (radius of 5-6 nm, for example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of 2-3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.[10][11][12] \n \nBecause of the high tunability of properties, QDs are of interest in many research applications such as transistors, solar cells, LEDs, and diode lasers. For example, the ability of QDs to precisely convert and tune a spectrum makes them ideal for LCD displays. Previous LCD displays can waste energy converting red-green poor, blue-yellow rich white light into a more balanced lighting. By using QDs, only the necessary colors for ideal images are contained in the screen. The result is a screen that is brighter, clearer, and more energy-efficient. The first commercial application of quantum dots was the Sony XBR X900A series of flat panel televisions released in 2013.[13] QDs are also being researched as possible qubits for quantum computing. Beyond electronic applications, QDs are also being investigated in the medical field for medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating.[14] These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less time consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication. \nPart of a series of articles on \nNanomaterials \nC60-rods.png \nFullerenes \n \n    Carbon nanotubes Buckminsterfullerene Fullerene chemistry Applications In popular culture Timeline Carbon allotropes \n \nNanoparticles \n \n    Quantum dots Nanostructures Colloidal gold Silver nanoparticles Iron nanoparticles Platinum nanoparticles \n \n    Portal icon Nanotechnology portal \n \n    v t e \n \nColloidal quantum dots irradiated with a UV light.

Here, rectangular and triangular-shaped quantum dots are shown. Energy states in rectangular dots are more s-type and p-type. However, in a triangular dot the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry. (Click for animation) \nMain article: Potential well \n \nIn a semiconductor crystallite whose size is smaller than twice the size of its exciton Bohr radius, the excitons are squeezed, leading to quantum confinement. The energy levels can then be modeled using the particle in a box model in which the energy of different states is dependent on the length of the box, much like the pitch of a string in a musical instrument is dependent on its length. Comparing the quantum dots size to the Bohr radius of the electron and hole wave functions, 3 regimes can be defined. A 'strong confinement regime' is defined as the quantum dots radius being smaller than both electron and hole Bohr radius, 'weak confinement' is given when the quantum dot is larger than both. For semiconductors in which electron and hole masses are markedly different, an 'intermediate confinement regime' exists, where the quantum dots radius is larger than the Bohr radius of one (typically the hole), but not the other charge carrier. \nSplitting of energy levels for small quantum dots due to the quantum confinement effect. The horizontal axis is the radius, or the size, of the quantum dots and ab* is the Exciton Bohr radius. \n \nBand gap energy \n    The band gap can become larger in the strong confinement regime where the size of the quantum dot is smaller than the Exciton Bohr radius ab* as the energy levels split up. \n \n        a^*_b = \varepsilon_rleft(\frac{m}{u}\right) a_b \n \n    where ab is the Bohr radius=0.053 nm, m is the mass, μ is the reduced mass, and εr is the size-dependent dielectric constant (Relative permittivity). \n    This results in the increase in the total emission energy (the sum of the energy levels in the smaller band gaps in the strong confinement regime is larger than the energy levels in the band gaps of the original levels in the weak confinement regime) and the emission at various wavelengths; which is precisely what happens in the sun, where the quantum confinement effects are completely dominant and the energy levels split up to the degree that the energy spectrum is almost continuous, thus emitting white light[citation needed]. \nConfinement energy \n    The exciton entity can be modeled using the particle in the box. The electron and the hole can be seen as hydrogen in the Bohr model with the hydrogen nucleus replaced by the hole of positive charge and negative electron mass. Then the energy levels of the exciton can be represented as the solution to the particle in a box at the ground level (n = 1) with the mass replaced by the reduced mass. Thus by varying the size of the quantum dot, the confinement energy of the exciton can be controlled. \nBound exciton energy \n    There is Coulomb attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole. The negative energy involved in the attraction is proportional to Rydberg's energy and inversely proportional to square of the size-dependent dielectric constant[15] of the semiconductor. When the size of the semiconductor crystal is smaller than the Exciton Bohr radius, the Coulomb interaction must be modified to fit the situation. \n \nTherefore, the sum of these energies can be represented as: \n \n    \begin{align} E_\textrm{confinement} &= \frac{hbar^2pi^2}{2 a^2}eft(\frac{1}{m_e} + \frac{1}{m_h}\right) = \frac{bar^2pi^2}{2mu a^2}\\ E_\textrm{exciton} &= -\frac{1}{epsilon_r^2}\frac{mu}{m_e}R_y = -R_y^*\\ E &= E_\textrm{band gap} + E_\textrm{confinement} + E_\textrm{exciton}\\ &= E_\textrm{band gap} + \frac{hbar^2pi^2}{2mu a^2} - R^*_y end{align} \n \nwhere μ is the reduced mass, a is the radius, me is the free electron mass, mh is the hole mass, and εr is the size-dependent dielectric constant. \n \nAlthough the above equations were derived using simplifying assumptions, the implications are clear; the energy of the quantum dots is dependent on their size due to the quantum confinement effects, which dominate below the critical size leading to changes in the optical properties. This effect of quantum confinement on the quantum dots has been experimentally verified[16] and is a key feature of many emerging electronic structures.[17][18] \n \nBesides confinement in all three dimensions (i.e., a quantum dot), other quantum confined semiconductors include: \n \n    Quantum wires, which confine electrons or holes in two spatial dimensions and allow free propagation in the third. \n    Quantum wells, which confine electrons or holes in one dimension and allow free propagation in two dimensions. \n \nProduction \nQuantum Dots with gradually stepping emission from violet to deep red are being produced in a kg scale at PlasmaChem GmbH \n \nThere are several ways to confine excitons in semiconductors, resulting in different methods to produce quantum-confined semiconductor structures. In general, quantum wires, wells and dots are grown by advanced epitaxial techniques. Nanocrystals may be produced by gas-phase, liquid-phase and solid-phase approaches.[19] \nColloidal synthesis \n \nColloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are synthesized from precursor compounds dissolved in solutions, much like traditional chemical processes. The synthesis of colloidal quantum dots is done by using precursors,[8] organic surfactants,[20] and solvents. Heating the solution at high temperature, the precursors decompose forming monomers which then nucleate and generate nanocrystals. The temperature during the synthetic process is a critical factor in determining optimal conditions for the nanocrystal growth. It must be high enough to allow for rearrangement and annealing of atoms during the synthesis process while being low enough to promote crystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that has to be stringently controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different regimes, ″focusing″ and ″defocusing″. At high monomer concentrations, the critical size (the size where nanocrystals neither grow nor shrink) is relatively small, resulting in growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones (since larger crystals need more atoms to grow than small crystals) resulting in ″focusing″ of the size distribution to yield nearly monodisperse particles. The size focusing is optimal when the monomer concentration is kept such that the average nanocrystal size present is always slightly larger than the critical size. Over time, the monomer concentration diminishes, the critical size becomes larger than the average size present, and the distribution ″defocuses″. \nCadmium sulfide quantum dots on cells \n \nThere are colloidal methods to produce many different semiconductors. Typical dots are made of binary compounds such as lead sulfide, lead selenide, cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, indium arsenide, and indium phosphide. Dots may also be made from ternary compounds such as cadmium selenide sulfide. These quantum dots can contain as few as 100 to 100,000 atoms within the quantum dot volume, with a diameter of ~ 10 to 50 atoms. This corresponds to about 2 to 10 nanometers, and at 10 nm in diameter, nearly 3 million quantum dots could be lined up end to end and fit within the width of a human thumb. \nColloidal nanoparticle of lead sulfide (selenide) with complete passivation by oleic acid, oleyl and hydroxyl (size ~5nm) \n \nLarge batches of quantum dots may be synthesized via colloidal synthesis. Due to this scalability and the convenience of benchtop conditions, colloidal synthetic methods are promising for commercial applications. It is acknowledged[citation needed] to be the least toxic of all the different forms of synthesis. \nPlasma synthesis \n \nPlasma synthesis has evolved to be one of the most popular gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots, especially those with covalent bonds.[21][22][23] For example, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be controlled in nonthermal plasma.[24][25] Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in plasma synthesis.[26][27][28] Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic solvents[29] or water[30] (i. e., colloidal quantum dots). \nFabrication \n \n    Self-assembled quantum dots are typically between 5 and 50 nm in size. Quantum dots defined by lithographically patterned gate electrodes, or by etching on two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures can have lateral dimensions between 20 and 100 nm. \n    Some quantum dots are small regions of one material buried in another with a larger band gap. These can be so-called core–shell structures, e.g., with CdSe in the core and ZnS in the shell or from special forms of silica called ormosil. \n    Quantum dots sometimes occur spontaneously in quantum well structures due to monolayer fluctuations in the well's thickness. \n    Self-assembled quantum dots nucleate spontaneously under certain conditions during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), when a material is grown on a substrate to which it is not lattice matched. The resulting strain produces coherently strained islands on top of a two-dimensional wetting layer. This growth mode is known as Stranski–Krastanov growth. The islands can be subsequently buried to form the quantum dot. This fabrication method has potential for applications in quantum cryptography (i.e. single photon sources) and quantum computation. The main limitations of this method are the cost of fabrication and the lack of control over positioning of individual dots. \n    Individual quantum dots can be created from two-dimensional electron or hole gases present in remotely doped quantum wells or semiconductor heterostructures called lateral quantum dots. The sample surface is coated with a thin layer of resist. A lateral pattern is then defined in the resist by electron beam lithography. This pattern can then be transferred to the electron or hole gas by etching, or by depositing metal electrodes (lift-off process) that allow the application of external voltages between the electron gas and the electrodes. Such quantum dots are mainly of interest for experiments and applications involving electron or hole transport, i.e., an electrical current. \n    The energy spectrum of a quantum dot can be engineered by controlling the geometrical size, shape, and the strength of the confinement potential. Also, in contrast to atoms, it is relatively easy to connect quantum dots by tunnel barriers to conducting leads, which allows the application of the techniques of tunneling spectroscopy for their investigation. \n \nThe quantum dot absorption features correspond to transitions between discrete,three-dimensional particle in a box states of the electron and the hole, both confined to the same nanometer-size box.These discrete transitions are reminiscent of atomic spectra and have resulted in quantum dots also being called artificial atoms.[31] \n \n    Confinement in quantum dots can also arise from electrostatic potentials (generated by external electrodes, doping, strain, or impurities). \n    CMOS technology can be employed to fabricate silicon quantum dots. Ultra small (L=20 nm, W=20 nm) CMOS transistors behave as single electron quantum dots when operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of −269 °C (4 K) to about −258 °C (15 K). The transistor displays Coulomb blockade due to progressive charging of electrons one by one. The number of electrons confined in the channel is driven by the gate voltage, starting from an occupation of zero electrons, and it can be set to 1 or many.[32] \n \nViral assembly \n \nLee et al. (2002) reported using genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage viruses to create quantum dot biocomposite structures.[33] As a background to this work, it has previously been shown that genetically engineered viruses can recognize specific semiconductor surfaces through the method of selection by combinatorial phage display.[34] Additionally, it is known that liquid crystalline structures of wild-type viruses (Fd, M13, and TMV) are adjustable by controlling the solution concentrations, solution ionic strength, and the external magnetic field applied to the solutions. Consequently, the specific recognition properties of the virus can be used to organize inorganic nanocrystals, forming ordered arrays over the length scale defined by liquid crystal formation. Using this information, Lee et al. (2000) were able to create self-assembled, highly oriented, self-supporting films from a phage and ZnS precursor solution. This system allowed them to vary both the length of bacteriophage and the type of inorganic material through genetic modification and selection. \nElectrochemical assembly \n \nHighly ordered arrays of quantum dots may also be self-assembled by electrochemical techniques. A template is created by causing an ionic reaction at an electrolyte-metal interface which results in the spontaneous assembly of nanostructures, including quantum dots, onto the metal which is then used as a mask for mesa-etching these nanostructures on a chosen substrate. \nBulk-manufacture \n \nQuantum dot manufacturing relies on a process called ″high temperature dual injection″ which has been scaled by multiple companies for commercial applications that require large quantities (hundreds of kilograms to tonnes) of quantum dots. This is a reproducible production method that can be applied to a wide range of quantum dot sizes and compositions. \n \nThe bonding in certain cadmium-free quantum dots, such as III-V-based quantum dots, is more covalent than that in II-VI materials, therefore it is more difficult to separate nanoparticle nucleation and growth via a high temperature dual injection synthesis. An alternative method of quantum dot synthesis, the “molecular seeding” process, provides a reproducible route to the production of high quality quantum dots in large volumes. The process utilises identical molecules of a molecular cluster compound as the nucleation sites for nanoparticle growth, thus avoiding the need for a high temperature injection step. Particle growth is maintained by the periodic addition of precursors at moderate temperatures until the desired particle size is reached.[35] The molecular seeding process is not limited to the production of cadmium-free quantum dots; for example, the process can be used to synthesise kilogram batches of high quality II-VI quantum dots in just a few hours. \n \nAnother approach for the mass production of colloidal quantum dots can be seen in the transfer of the well-known hot-injection methodology for the synthesis to a technical continuous flow system. The batch-to-batch variations arising from the needs during the mentioned methodology can be overcome by utilizing technical components for mixing and growth as well as transport and temperature adjustments. For the production of CdSe based semiconductor nanoparticles this method has been investigated and tuned to production amounts of kg per month. Since the use of technical components allows for easy interchange in regards of maximum through-put and size, it can be further enhanced to tens or even hundreds of kilograms.[36] \n \nIn 2011 a consortium of U.S. and Dutch companies reported a ″milestone″ in high volume quantum dot manufacturing by applying the traditional high temperature dual injection method to a flow system.[37] \n \nOn January 23, 2013 Dow entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with UK-based Nanoco for the use of their low-temperature molecular seeding method for bulk manufacture of cadmium-free quantum dots for electronic displays, and on September 24, 2014 Dow commenced work on the production facility in South Korea capable of producing sufficient quantum dots for ″millions of cadmium-free televisions and other devices, such as tablets″. Mass production is due to commence in mid-2015.[38] On 24 March 2015 Dow announced a partnership deal with LG Electronics to develop the use of cadmium free quantum dots in displays.[39] \nHeavy metal-free quantum dots \n \nIn many regions of the world there is now a restriction or ban on the use of heavy metals in many household goods, which means that most cadmium based quantum dots are unusable for consumer-goods applications. \n \nFor commercial viability, a range of restricted, heavy metal-free quantum dots has been developed showing bright emissions in the visible and near infra-red region of the spectrum and have similar optical properties to those of CdSe quantum dots. Among these systems are InP/ZnS and CuInS/ZnS, for example. \n \nPeptides are being researched as potential quantum dot material.[40] Since peptides occur naturally in all organisms, such dots would likely be nontoxic and easily biodegraded. \nSafety \nEnvironmental impact \n \nThe environmental impact of bulk manufacturing and consumption of quantum dots is currently undergoing studies in both private and public labs.[citation needed] \nBiological Toxicity \n \nDespite the invaluable potential applications of quantum dots, current literature reveals that some quantum dots pose risks to human health and the environment under certain condition.[41][42][43] Notably, the studies on quantum dots toxicity are focused on cadmium containing particles and has yet to be demonstrated in animal models after physiologically relevant dosing.[43] In vitro studies, based on cell cultures, on quantum dots (QD) toxicity suggests that their toxicity may derive from multiple factors including its physicochemical characteristics (size, shape, composition, surface functional groups, and surface charges) and environment. Assessing their potential toxicity is complex as these factors include properties such as QD size, charge, concentration, chemical composition, capping ligands, and also on their oxidative, mechanical and photolytic stability.[41] \n \nMany research studies have focused on the mechanism of QD cytotoxicity using model cell cultures. It has been demonstrated that after exposure to ultraviolet radiation or oxidized by air CdSe QDs release free cadmium ions causing cell death.[44] Group II-VI QDs also have been reported to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species after exposure to light, which in turn can damage cellular components such as proteins, lipids and DNA.[45] Some studies have also demonstrated that addition of a ZnS shell inhibit the process of reactive oxygen species in CdSe QDs. Another aspect of QD toxicity is the process of their size dependent intracellular pathways that concentrate these particles in cellular organelles that are inaccessible by metal ions, which may result in unique patterns of cytotoxicity compared to their constituent metal ions.[46] The reports of QD localization in the cell nucleus[47] present additional modes of toxicity because they may induce DNA mutation, which in turn will propagate through future generation of cells causing diseases. \n \nThough concentration of QDs in certain organelles have been reported in in vivo studies using animal models, interestingly, no alterations in animal behavior, weight, hematological markers or organ damage has been found through either histological or biochemical analysis.[48] These finding have led scientists to believe that intracellular dose is the most important deterring factor for QD toxicity. Therefore factors determining the QD endocytosis that determine the effective intracellular concentration, such as QD size, shape and surface chemistry determine their toxicity. Excretion of QDs through urine in animal models also have demonstrated via injecting radio-labeled ZnS capped CdSe QDs where the ligand shell was labelled with 99mTc.[49] Though multiple other studies have concluded retention of QDs in cellular levels,[43][50] exocytosis of QDs is still poorly studied in the literature. \n \nWhile significant research efforts have broadened the understanding of toxicity of QDs, there are large discrepancies in the literature and questions still remains to be answered. Diversity of this class material as compared to normal chemical substances makes the assessment of their toxicity very challenging. As their toxicity may also be dynamic depending on the environmental factors such as pH level, light exposure and cell type, traditional methods of assessing toxicity of chemicals such as LD50 are not applicable for QDs. Therefore researchers are focusing on introducing novel approaches and adapting existing methods to include this unique class of materials.[43] Furthermore, novel strategies to engineer safer QDs are still under exploration by the scientific community. \nOptical properties \nFluorescence spectra of CdTe quantum dots of various sizes. Different sized quantum dots emit different color light due to quantum confinement. \n \nIn semiconductors, light absorption generally leads to an electron being excited from the valence to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole. The electron and the hole can bind to each other to form an exciton. When this exciton recombines (i.e. the electron resumes its ground state), the exciton's energy can be emitted as light. This is called Fluorescence. In a simplified model, the energy of the emitted photon can be understood as the sum of the band gap energy between the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied energy level, the confinement energies of the hole and the excited electron, and the bound energy of the exciton (the electron-hole pair): \n \nthe figure is a simplified representation showing the excited electron and the hole in an exciton entity and the corresponding energy levels. The total energy involved can be seen as the sum of the band gap energy, the energy involved in the Coulomb attraction in the exciton, and the confinement energies of the excited electron and the hole \n \nAs the confinement energy depends on the quantum dots size, both absorption onset and fluorescence emission can be tuned by changing the size of the quantum dot during its synthesis. The larger the dot, the redder (lower energy) its absorption onset and fluorescence spectrum. Conversely, smaller dots absorb and emit bluer (higher energy) light. Recent articles in Nanotechnology and in other journals have begun to suggest that the shape of the quantum dot may be a factor in the coloration as well, but as yet not enough information is available. Furthermore, it was shown [51] that the lifetime of fluorescence is determined by the size of the quantum dot. Larger dots have more closely spaced energy levels in which the electron-hole pair can be trapped. Therefore, electron-hole pairs in larger dots live longer causing larger dots to show a longer lifetime. \n \nTo improve fluorescence quantum yield, quantum dots can be made with ″shells″ of a larger bandgap semiconductor material around them. The improvement is suggested to be due to the reduced access of electron and hole to non-radiative surface recombination pathways in some cases, but also due to reduced auger recombination in others. \nApplications \n \nQuantum dots are particularly significant for optical applications due to their high extinction coefficient.[52] In electronic applications they have been proven to operate like a single electron transistor and show the Coulomb blockade effect. Quantum dots have also been suggested as implementations of qubits for quantum information processing. \n \nThe ability to tune the size of quantum dots is advantageous for many applications. For instance, larger quantum dots have a greater spectrum-shift towards red compared to smaller dots, and exhibit less pronounced quantum properties. Conversely, the smaller particles allow one to take advantage of more subtle quantum effects. \nResearchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a device that efficiently produces visible light, through energy transfer from thin layers of quantum wells to crystals above the layers.[53] \n \nBeing zero-dimensional, quantum dots have a sharper density of states than higher-dimensional structures. As a result, they have superior transport and optical properties, and are being researched for use in diode lasers, amplifiers, and biological sensors. Quantum dots may be excited within a locally enhanced electromagnetic field produced by gold nanoparticles, which can then be observed from the surface plasmon resonance in the photoluminescent excitation spectrum of (CdSe)ZnS nanocrystals. High-quality quantum dots are well suited for optical encoding and multiplexing applications due to their broad excitation profiles and narrow/symmetric emission spectra. The new generations of quantum dots have far-reaching potential for the study of intracellular processes at the single-molecule level, high-resolution cellular imaging, long-term in vivo observation of cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and diagnostics. \n \nMoreover, a new range of applications involving quantum dots became accessible through the exploitation of CdSe nanocrystals as efficient triplet photosensitizers.[54] Laser excitation of small CdSe nanoparticles enables the extraction of the excited state energy from the Quantum Dots into bulk solution, thus opening the door to a wide range of applications such as photodynamic therapy, photovoltaic devices, molecular electronics, and catalysis. \nComputing \n \nQuantum dot technology is one of the most promising candidates for use in solid-state quantum computation. By applying small voltages to the leads, the flow of electrons through the quantum dot can be controlled and thereby precise measurements of the spin and other properties therein can be made. With several entangled quantum dots, or qubits, plus a way of performing operations, quantum calculations and the computers that would perform them might be possible. \nBiology \n \nIn modern biological analysis, various kinds of organic dyes are used. However, as technology advances, greater flexibility in these dyes is required which traditional dyes are often unable to provide.[55] To this end, quantum dots have quickly filled in the role, being found to be superior to traditional organic dyes on several counts, one of the most immediately obvious being brightness (owing to the high extinction coefficient combined with a comparable quantum yield to fluorescent dyes[56]) as well as their stability (allowing much less photobleaching). It has been estimated that quantum dots are 20 times brighter and 100 times more stable than traditional fluorescent reporters.[55] For single-particle tracking, the irregular blinking of quantum dots is a minor drawback. However, there have been groups which have developed quantum dots which are essentially nonblinking and demonstrated their utility in single molecule tracking experiments.[57][58] \n \nThe usage of quantum dots for highly sensitive cellular imaging has seen major advances over the past decade.[59] The improved photostability of quantum dots, for example, allows the acquisition of many consecutive focal-plane images that can be reconstructed into a high-resolution three-dimensional image.[60] Another application that takes advantage of the extraordinary photostability of quantum dot probes is the real-time tracking of molecules and cells over extended periods of time.[61] Antibodies, streptavidin,[62] peptides,[63] DNA,[64] nucleic acid aptamers,[65] or small-molecule ligands [20] can be used to target quantum dots to specific proteins on cells. Researchers were able to observe quantum dots in lymph nodes of mice for more than 4 months.[66] \n \nSemiconductor quantum dots have also been employed for in vitro imaging of pre-labeled cells. The ability to image single-cell migration in real time is expected to be important to several research areas such as embryogenesis, cancer metastasis, stem cell therapeutics, and lymphocyte immunology. \n \nOne particular application of Quantum dots in biology is as donor fluorophores in Förster resonance energy transfer, where the large extinction coefficient and spectral purity of these fluorophores make them superior to molecular fluorophores[67] It is also worth noting that the broad absorbance of QDs allows selective excitation of the QD donor and a minimum excitation of a dye acceptor in FRET-based studies.[68] The applicability of the FRET model, which assumes that the Quantum Dot can be approximated as a point dipole, has recently been demonstrated[69] \n \nScientists have proven that quantum dots are dramatically better than existing methods for delivering a gene-silencing tool, known as siRNA, into cells.[70] \n \nFirst attempts have been made to use quantum dots for tumor targeting under in vivo conditions. There exist two basic targeting schemes: active targeting and passive targeting. In the case of active targeting, quantum dots are functionalized with tumor-specific binding sites to selectively bind to tumor cells. Passive targeting uses the enhanced permeation and retention of tumor cells for the delivery of quantum dot probes. Fast-growing tumor cells typically have more permeable membranes than healthy cells, allowing the leakage of small nanoparticles into the cell body. Moreover, tumor cells lack an effective lymphatic drainage system, which leads to subsequent nanoparticle-accumulation. \n \nOne of the remaining issues with quantum dot probes is their potential in vivo toxicity. For example, CdSe nanocrystals are highly toxic to cultured cells under UV illumination. The energy of UV irradiation is close to that of the covalent chemical bond energy of CdSe nanocrystals. As a result, semiconductor particles can be dissolved, in a process known as photolysis, to release toxic cadmium ions into the culture medium. In the absence of UV irradiation, however, quantum dots with a stable polymer coating have been found to be essentially nontoxic.[66][71] Hydrogel encapsulation of quantum dots allows for quantum dots to be introduced into a stable aqueous solution, reducing the possibility of cadmium leakage.Then again, only little is known about the excretion process of quantum dots from living organisms.[72] \n \nAnother potential cutting-edge application of quantum dots is being researched, with quantum dots acting as the inorganic fluorophore for intra-operative detection of tumors using fluorescence spectroscopy. \n \nDelivery of undamaged quantum dots to the cell cytoplasm has been a challenge with existing techniques. Vector-based methods have resulted in aggregation and endosomal sequestration of quantum dots while electroporation can damage the semi-conducting particles and aggregate delivered dots in the cytosol. Cell squeezing – a method invented in 2013 by Armon Sharei, Robert Langer and Klavs Jensen at MIT – has demonstrated efficient cytosolic delivery of quantum dots without inducing aggregation, trapping material in endosomes, or significant loss of cell viability. Moreover, it has shown that individual quantum dots delivered by this approach are detectable in the cell cytosol, thus illustrating the potential of this technique for single molecule tracking studies. These results indicate that Cell squeezing could potentially be implemented as a robust platform for quantum dot based imaging in a variety of applications.[73] \nPhotovoltaic devices \nMain article: Quantum dot solar cell \n \nThe tunable absorption spectrum and high extinction coefficients of quantum dots have made them attractive for light harvesting technologies such as photovoltaics. Quantum dots may be able to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of today's typical silicon photovoltaic cells. According to an experimental proof from 2004,[74] quantum dots of lead selenide can produce more than one exciton from one high energy photon via the process of carrier multiplication or multiple exciton generation (MEG). This compares favorably to today's photovoltaic cells which can only manage one exciton per high-energy photon, with high kinetic energy carriers losing their energy as heat. Quantum dot photovoltaics would theoretically be cheaper to manufacture, as they can be made ″using simple chemical reactions.″ \nQuantum Dot only Solar Cells \n \nResearch published by Nano Letters in 2015 suggests that aromatic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) (e.g. 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can be used to improve the band alignment at electrodes for better efficiencies. This technique has provided a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.7%.[75] The SAM is positioned between ZnO-PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) film junction to modify band alignment via the dipole moment of the constituent SAM molecule, and the band tuning may be modified via the density, dipole and the orientation of the SAM molecule.[75] \nQuantum Dot in Hybrid Solar Cells \n \nColloidal quantum dots are also used in inorganic/organic hybrid solar cells. These solar cells are attractive because of potentially their low-cost fabrication and relatively high efficiency.[76] Incorporation of metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, and Nb2O5 nanomaterials into organic photovoltaics have been commercialized using full roll-to-roll processing.[76] In 2015, a publication in Scientific Reports show a 13.2% power conversion efficiency in Si nanowire/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells.[77] \nQuantum Dot with Nanowire in Solar Cells \n \nAnother use of quantum dots was researched in 2007 when a group from the University of Minnesota created a photovoltaic device that included capping single-crystal ZnO nanowires with CdSe quantum dots, immersed in mercaptopropionic acid as hole transport medium in order to obtain a QD-sensitized solar cell. The morphology of the nanowires allowed the electrons to have a direct pathway to the photoanode. This form of solar cell has been shown to exhibit 50-60% internal quantum efficiencies.[78] \n \nNanowires with quantum dot coatings have been researched by individuals at University of Science and Technology of China, with silicon nanowires (SiNW) and carbon quantum dots. The use of SiNWs instead of planar silicon enhances the antiflection properties of Si.[79] The SiNW exhibits a light-trapping effect due to light trapping in the SiNW. This use of SiNWs in conjunction with carbon quantum dots resulted in a solar cell that reached 9.10% PCE.[79] \n \nGraphene quantum dots have also been blended with organic electronic materials to improve efficiency and lower cost in photovoltaic devices and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) in compared to graphene sheets. These graphene quantum dots were functionalized with organic ligands that experience photoluminescence from UV-Vis absorption.[80] \nLight emitting devices \nSee also: Light-emitting diode § Quantum dot LEDs \n \nThere are several proposed methods for using quantum dots to improve existing light-emitting diode (LED) design, including ″Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diode″ (QD-LED) displays and ″Quantum Dot White Light Emitting Diode″ (QD-WLED) displays. Because Quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light, they can be more efficient than light sources which must be color filtered. QD-LEDs can be fabricated on a silicon substrate, which allows them to be integrated onto standard silicon-based integrated circuits or microelectromechanical systems.[81] Quantum dots are valued for displays, because they emit light in very specific gaussian distributions. This can result in a display with visibly more accurate colors. A conventional color liquid crystal display (LCD) is usually backlit by fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) or conventional white LEDs that are color filtered to produce red, green, and blue pixels. An improvement is using a conventional blue-emitting LED as light source and converting part of the emitted light into pure green and red light by the appropriate quantum dots placed in front of the blue LED. This type of white light as the backlight of an LCD panel allows for the best color gamut at lower cost than a RGB LED combination using three LEDs. \n \nIn June 2006, QD Vision announced technical success in making a proof-of-concept quantum dot display and show a bright emission in the visible and near infra-red region of the spectrum. A QD-LED integrated at a scanning microscopy tip was used to demonstrate fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) imaging.[82] \nPhotodetector devices \n \nQuantum dot photodetectors (QDPs) can be fabricated either via solution-processing,[83] or from conventional single-crystalline semiconductors.[84] Conventional single-crystalline semiconductor QDPs are precluded from integration with flexible organic electronics due to the incompatibility of their growth conditions with the process windows required by organic semiconductors. On the other hand, solution-processed QDPs can be readily integrated with an almost infinite variety of substrates, and also postprocessed atop other integrated circuits. Such colloidal QDPs have potential applications in surveillance, machine vision, industrial inspection, spectroscopy, and fluorescent biomedical imaging. \nPhotocatalysts \nMain article: Photocatalysis \n \nQuantum dots also function as photocatalysts for the light driven chemical conversion of water into hydrogen as a pathway to solar fuel. In photocatalysis, electron hole pairs formed in the dot under band gap excitation drive redox reactions in the surrounding liquid. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of the dots is related to the particle size and its degree of quantum confinement.[85] This is because the band gap determines the chemical energy that is stored in the dot in the excited state. An obstacle for the use of quantum dots in photocatalysis is the presence of surfactants on the surface of the dots. These surfactants (or ligands) interfere with the chemical reactivity of the dots by slowing down mass transfer and electron transfer processes. Also, quantum dots made of metal chalcogenides are chemically unstable under oxidizing conditions and undergo photo corrosion reactions. \nTheoretical models \n \nA variety of theoretical frameworks exist to model optical, electronic, and structural properties of quantum dots. These may be broadly divided into quantum mechanical, semiclassical, and classical. \nQuantum mechanics \n \nQuantum mechanical models and simulations of quantum dots often involve the interaction of electrons with a pseudopotential or random matrix.[86] \nSemiclassical \n \nSemiclassical models of quantum dots frequently incorporate a chemical potential. For example, The thermodynamic chemical potential of an N-particle system is given by \n \n    mu(N) = E(N) - E(N-1) \n \nwhose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The definition of capacitance, \n \n    {1over C} quiv {Delta ,VoverDelta ,Q}, \n \nwith the potential difference \n \n    Delta ,V = {Delta ,mu ,over e} = {mu(N+Delta ,N) -mu(N) over e} \n \nmay be applied to a quantum dot with the addition or removal of individual electrons, \n \n    Delta ,N = 1 and Delta ,Q=e. \n \nThen \n \n    C(N) = {e^2overmu(N+1)-mu(N)} = {e^2 over I(N)-A(N)} \n \nis the ″quantum capacitance″ of a quantum dot, where we denoted by I(N) the ionization potential and by A(N) the electron affinity of the N-particle system.[87] \nClassical mechanics \n \nClassical models of electrostatic properties of electrons in quantum dots are similar in nature to the Thomson problem of optimally distributing electrons on a unit sphere. \n \nThe classical electrostatic treatment of electrons confined to spherical quantum dots is similar to their treatment in the Thomson,[88] or plum pudding model, of the atom.[89] \n \nThe classical treatment of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum dots exhibit electron shell-filling behavior. A ″periodic table of classical artificial atoms″ has been described for two-dimensional quantum dots.[90] As well, several connections have been reported between the three-dimensional Thomson problem and electron shell-filling patterns found in naturally-occurring atoms found throughout the periodic table.[91] This latter work originated in classical electrostatic modeling of electrons in a spherical quantum dot represented by an ideal dielectric sphere.[92]",
